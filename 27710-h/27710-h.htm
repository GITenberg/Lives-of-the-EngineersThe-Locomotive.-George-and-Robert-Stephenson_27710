class="pagenum">p. iii</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Since the appearance of this book in its original form, some
seventeen years since, the construction of Railways has continued
to make extraordinary progress.&nbsp; Although Great Britain,
first in the field, had then, after about twenty-five
years&rsquo; work, expended nearly 300 millions sterling in the
construction of 8300 miles of railway, it has, during the last
seventeen years, expended about 288 millions more in constructing
7780 additional miles.</p>
<p>But the construction of railways has proceeded with equal
rapidity on the Continent.&nbsp; France, Germany, Spain, Sweden,
Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, have largely added to their
railway mileage.&nbsp; Austria is actively engaged in carrying
new lines across the plains of Hungary, which Turkey is preparing
to meet by lines carried up the valley of the Lower Danube.&nbsp;
Russia is also occupied with extensive schemes for connecting
Petersburg and Moscow with her ports in the Black Sea on the one
hand, and with the frontier towns of her Asiatic empire on the
other.</p>
<p>Italy is employing her new-born liberty in vigorously
extending railways throughout her dominions.&nbsp; A direct line
of communication has already been opened between France and
Italy, through the Mont Cenis Tunnel; while <!-- page iv--><a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>another has
been opened between Germany and Italy through the Brenner
Pass,&mdash;so that the entire journey may now be made by two
different railway routes (excepting only the short sea-passage
across the English Channel) from London to Brindisi, situated in
the south-eastern extremity of the Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>During the last sixteen years, nearly the whole of the Indian
railways have been made.&nbsp; When Edmund Burke, in 1783,
arraigned the British Government for their neglect of India in
his speech on Mr. Fox&rsquo;s Bill, he said: &ldquo;England has
built no bridges, made no high roads, cut no navigations, dug out
no reservoirs. . . .&nbsp; Were we to be driven out of India this
day, nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed,
during the inglorious period of our dominion, by anything better
than the ourang-outang or the tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that reproach no longer exists.&nbsp; Some of the greatest
bridges erected in modern times&mdash;such as those over the Sone
near Patna, and over the Jumna at Allahabad&mdash;have been
erected in connection with the Indian railways.&nbsp; More than
5000 miles are now at work, and they have been constructed at an
expenditure of about &pound;88,000,000 of British capital,
guaranteed by the British Government.&nbsp; The Indian railways
connect the capitals of the three Presidencies&mdash;uniting
Bombay with Madras on the south, and with Calcutta on the
north-east&mdash;while a great main line, 2200 miles in extent,
passing through the north-western provinces, and connecting
Calcutta with Lucknow, Delhi, Lahore, Moultan, and Kurrachee,
unites the mouths of the Hooghly in the Bay of Bengal with those
of the Indus in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>When the first edition of this work appeared, in the
beginning of 1857, the Canadian system of railways was but in its
infancy.&nbsp; The Grand Trunk was only begun, and the Victoria
Bridge&mdash;the greatest of all railway structures&mdash;was not
half erected.&nbsp; The Colony of Canada has now more than 3000
miles in active operation along the great valley of the St.
Lawrence, connecting Rivi&egrave;re du Loup at the mouth of that
river, and the harbour of Portland in the State of Maine,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Montreal and Toronto, with Sarnia on Lake Huron,
and with Windsor, opposite Detroit in the State of
Michigan.&nbsp; During the same time the Australian Colonies have
been actively engaged in providing themselves with railways, many
of which are at work, and others are in course of
formation.&nbsp; The Cape of Good Hope has several lines open,
and others making.&nbsp; France has constructed about 400 miles
in Algeria; while the Pasha of Egypt is the proprietor of 360
miles in operation across the Egyptian desert.&nbsp; The Japanese
are also making railroads.</p>
<p>But in no country has railway construction been prosecuted
with greater vigour than in the United States.&nbsp; There the
railway furnishes not only the means of intercommunication
between already established settlements, as in the Old World; but
it is regarded as the pioneer of colonization, and as
instrumental in opening up new and fertile territories of vast
extent in the west,&mdash;the food-grounds of future
nations.&nbsp; Hence railway construction in that country was
scarcely interrupted even by the great Civil War,&mdash;at the
commencement of which Mr. Seward publicly expressed the opinion
that &ldquo;physical bonds&mdash;such as highways, railroads,
rivers, and canals&mdash;are vastly <!-- page vi--><a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>more powerful
for holding civil communities together than any mere covenants,
though written on parchment or engraved on iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people of the United States were the first to follow the
example of England, after the practicability of steam locomotion
had been proved on the Stockton and Darlington, and Liverpool and
Manchester Railways.&nbsp; The first sod of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railway was cut on the 4th of July, 1828, and the line was
completed and opened for traffic in the following year, when it
was worked partly by horse-power, and partly by a locomotive
built at Baltimore, which is still preserved in the
Company&rsquo;s workshops.&nbsp; In 1830, the Hudson and Mohawk
Railway was begun, while other lines were under construction in
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Jersey; and in the course of
ten years, 1843 miles were finished and in operation.&nbsp; In
ten more years, 8827 miles were at work; at the end of 1864,
35,000 miles; and at the 31st of December, 1873, not less than
70,651 miles were in operation, of which 3916 had been made
during that year.&nbsp; One of the most extensive trunk-lines is
the Great Pacific Railroad, connecting the lines in the valleys
of the Mississippi and the Missouri with the city of San
Francisco on the shores of the Pacific, by means of which it is
possible to make the journey from England to Hong Kong, via New
York, in little more than a month.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The results of the working of railways have been in many
respects different from those anticipated by their
projectors.&nbsp; One of the most unexpected has been the growth
of an immense passenger-traffic.&nbsp; The Stockton <!-- page
vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>and Darlington line was projected as a coal line only,
and the Liverpool and Manchester as a merchandise line.&nbsp;
Passengers were not taken into account as a source of revenue,
for at the time of their projection, it was not believed that
people would trust themselves to be drawn upon a railway by an
&ldquo;explosive machine,&rdquo; as the locomotive was described
to be.&nbsp; Indeed, a writer of eminence declared that he would
as soon think of being fired off on a ricochet rocket, as travel
on a railway at twice the speed of the old stagecoaches.&nbsp; So
great was the alarm which existed as to the locomotive, that the
Liverpool and Manchester Committee pledged themselves in their
second prospectus, issued in 1825, &ldquo;not to require any
clause empowering its use;&rdquo; and as late as 1829, the
Newcastle and Carlisle Act was conceded on the express condition
that the line should not be worked by locomotives, but by horses
only.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Liverpool and Manchester Company obtained
powers to make and work their railway without any such
restriction; and when the line was made and opened, a locomotive
passenger train was advertised to be run upon it, by way of
experiment.&nbsp; Greatly to the surprise of the directors, more
passengers presented themselves as travellers by the train than
could conveniently be carried.</p>
<p>The first arrangements as to passenger-traffic were of a very
primitive character, being mainly copied from the old stage-coach
system.&nbsp; The passengers were &ldquo;booked&rdquo; at the
railway office, and their names were entered in a way-bill which
was given to the guard when the train started.&nbsp; Though the
usual stage-coach bugleman could not conveniently accompany the
passengers, the trains <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>were at
first played out of the terminal stations by a lively tune
performed by a trumpeter at the end of the platform; and this
continued to be done at the Manchester Station until a
comparatively recent date.</p>
<p>But the number of passengers carried by the Liverpool and
Manchester line was so unexpectedly great, that it was very soon
found necessary to remodel the entire system.&nbsp; Tickets were
introduced, by which a great saving of time was effected.&nbsp;
More roomy and commodious carriages were provided, the original
first-class compartments being seated for four passengers
only.&nbsp; Everything was found to have been in the first
instance made too light and too slight.&nbsp; The prize
&lsquo;Rocket,&rsquo; which weighed only 4&frac12; tons when
loaded with its coke and water, was found quite unsuited for
drawing the increasingly heavy loads of passengers.&nbsp; There
was also this essential difference between the old stage-coach
and the new railway train, that, whereas the former was
&ldquo;full&rdquo; with six inside and ten outside, the latter
must be able to accommodate whatever number of passengers came to
be carried.&nbsp; Hence heavier and more powerful engines, and
larger and more substantial carriages were from time to time
added to the carrying stock of the railway.</p>
<p>The speed of the trains was also increased.&nbsp; The first
locomotives used in hauling coal-trains ran at from four to six
miles an hour.&nbsp; On the Stockton and Darlington line the
speed was increased to about ten miles an hour; and on the
Liverpool and Manchester line the first passenger-trains were run
at the average speed of seventeen miles an hour, which at that
time was considered very fast.&nbsp; But this was not
enough.&nbsp; When the London and <!-- page ix--><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>Birmingham
line was opened, the mail-trains were run at twenty-three miles
an hour; and gradually the speed went up, until now the fast
trains are run at from fifty to sixty miles an hour,&mdash;the
pistons in the cylinders, at sixty miles, travelling at the
inconceivable rapidity of 800 feet per minute!</p>
<p>To bear the load of heavy engines run at high speeds, a much
stronger and heavier road was found necessary; and shortly after
the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line, it was entirely
relaid with stronger materials.&nbsp; Now that express
passenger-engines are from thirty to thirty-five tons each, the
weight of the rails has been increased from 35 lbs. to 75 lbs. or
86 lbs. to the yard.&nbsp; Stone blocks have given place to
wooden sleepers; rails with loose ends resting on the chairs, to
rails with their ends firmly &ldquo;fished&rdquo; together; and
in many places, where the traffic is unusually heavy, iron rails
have been replaced by those of steel.</p>
<p>And now see the enormous magnitude to which railway
passenger-traffic has grown.&nbsp; In the year 1873, 401,465,086
passengers were carried by day tickets in Great Britain
alone.&nbsp; But this was not all.&nbsp; For in that year 257,470
periodical tickets were issued by the different railways; and
assuming half of them to be annual, one-fourth half-yearly, and
the remainder quarterly tickets, and that their holders made only
five journeys each way weekly, this would give an additional
number of 47,024,000 journeys, or a total of 448,489,086
passengers carried in Great Britain in one year.</p>
<p>It is difficult to grasp the idea of the enormous number of
persons represented by these figures.&nbsp; The mind is <!-- page
x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>merely
bewildered by them, and can form no adequate notion of their
magnitude.&nbsp; To reckon them singly would occupy twenty-five
years, counting at the rate of one a second for twelve hours
every day.&nbsp; Or take another illustration.&nbsp; Supposing
every man, woman, and child in Great Britain to make ten journeys
by rail yearly, the number would greatly fall short of the
passengers carried in 1873.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter, in his &lsquo;Progress of the Nation,&rsquo;
estimated that thirty millions of passengers, or about eighty-two
thousand a day, travelled by coaches in Great Britain in 1834, an
average distance of twelve miles each, at an average cost of 5s.
a passenger, or at the rate of 5d. a mile; whereas above 448
millions are now carried by railway an average distance of
8&frac12; miles each, at an average cost of 1s. 1&frac12;d. per
passenger, or about three halfpence per mile, in considerably
less than one-fourth of the time.</p>
<p>But besides the above number of passengers, over one hundred
and sixty-two million tons of minerals and merchandise were
carried by railway in the United Kingdom in 1873, besides mails,
cattle, parcels, and other traffic.&nbsp; The distance run by
passenger and goods trains in the year was 162,561,304 miles; to
accomplish which it is estimated that four miles of railway must
have been covered by running trains during every second all the
year round.</p>
<p>To perform this service, there were, in 1873, 11,255
locomotives at work in the United Kingdom, consuming about four
million tons of coal and coke, and flashing into the air every
minute some forty tons of water in the form of steam in a high
state of elasticity.&nbsp; There were also <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>24,644
passenger-carriages, 9128 vans and breaks attached to
passenger-trains, and 329,163 trucks, waggons, and other vehicles
appropriated to merchandise.&nbsp; Buckled together, buffer to
buffer, the locomotives and tenders would extend from London to
Peterborough; while the carrying vehicles, joined together, would
form two trains occupying a double line of railway extending from
London to beyond Inverness.</p>
<p>A notable feature in the growth of railway traffic of late
years has been the increase in the number of third-class
passengers, compared with first and second class.&nbsp; Sixteen
years since, the third-class passengers constituted only about
one-third; ten years later, they were about one-half; whereas now
they form more than three-fourths of the whole number
carried.&nbsp; In 1873, there were about 23 million first-class
passengers, 62 million second-class, and not less than 306
million third-class.&nbsp; Thus George Stephenson&rsquo;s
prediction, &ldquo;that the time would come when it would be
cheaper for a working man to make a journey by railway than to
walk on foot,&rdquo; is already verified.</p>
<p>The degree of safety with which this great traffic has been
conducted is not the least remarkable of its features.&nbsp; Of
course, so long as railways are worked by men they will be liable
to the imperfections belonging to all things human.&nbsp; Though
their machinery may be perfect and their organisation as complete
as skill and forethought can make it, workmen will at times be
forgetful and listless; and a moment&rsquo;s carelessness may
lead to the most disastrous results.&nbsp; Yet, taking all
circumstances into account, the wonder is, that travelling by
<!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>railway at high speed should have been rendered
comparatively so safe.</p>
<p>To be struck by lightning is one of the rarest of all causes
of death; yet more persons are killed by lightning in Great
Britain than are killed on railways from causes beyond their own
control.&nbsp; Most persons would consider the probability of
their dying by hanging to be extremely remote; yet, according to
the Registrar-General&rsquo;s returns, it is considerably greater
than that of being killed by railway accident.</p>
<p>The remarkable safety with which railway traffic is on the
whole conducted, is due to constant watchfulness and
highly-applied skill.&nbsp; The men who work the railways are for
the most part the picked men of the country, and every railway
station may be regarded as a practical school of industry,
attention, and punctuality.</p>
<p>Few are aware of the complicated means and agencies that are
in constant operation on railways day and night, to ensure the
safety of the passengers to their journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; The
road is under a system of continuous inspection.&nbsp; The
railway is watched by foremen, with &ldquo;gangs&rdquo; of men
under them, in lengths varying from twelve to five miles,
according to circumstances.&nbsp; Their continuous duty is to see
that the rails and chairs are sound, their fastenings complete,
and the line clear of all obstructions.</p>
<p>Then, at all the junctions, sidings, and crossings, pointsmen
are stationed, with definite instructions as to the duties to be
performed by them.&nbsp; At these places, signals are provided,
worked from the station platforms, or from special signal boxes,
for the purpose of protecting the stopping or passing
trains.&nbsp; When the first railways <!-- page xiii--><a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>were
opened, the signals were of a very simple kind.&nbsp; The station
men gave them with their arms stretched out in different
positions; then flags of different colours were used; next fixed
signals, with arms or discs of rectangular or triangular
shape.&nbsp; These were followed by a complete system of
semaphore signals, near and distant, protecting all junctions,
sidings, and crossings.</p>
<p>When Government inspectors were first appointed by the Board
of Trade to examine and report upon the working of railways, they
were alarmed by the number of trains following each other at some
stations, in what then seemed to be a very rapid
succession.&nbsp; A passage from a Report written in 1840 by Sir
Frederick Smith, as to the traffic at &ldquo;Taylor&rsquo;s
Junction,&rdquo; on the York and North Midland Railway, contrasts
curiously with the railway life and activity of the present
day:&mdash;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; wrote the alarmed Inspector,
&ldquo;the passenger trains from York as well as Leeds and Selby,
meet four times a day.&nbsp; No less than 23 passenger-trains
stop at or pass this station in the 21 hours&mdash;an amount of
traffic requiring not only the utmost perfect arrangements on the
part of the management, but the utmost vigilance and energy in
the servants of the Company employed at this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrast this with the state of things now.&nbsp; On the
Metropolitan Line, 667 trains pass a given point in one direction
or the other during the eighteen hours of the working day, or an
average of 36 trains an hour.&nbsp; At the Cannon Street Station
of the South-Eastern Railway, 627 trains pass in and out daily,
many of them crossing each other&rsquo;s tracks under the
protection of the station-signals.&nbsp; Forty-five trains run in
and out between 9 and <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and an equal number between 4 and 5 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; Again, at the Clapham Junction,
near London, about 700 trains pass or stop daily; and though to
the casual observer the succession of trains coming and going,
running and stopping, coupling and shunting, appears a scene of
inextricable confusion and danger, the whole is clearly
intelligible to the signalmen in their boxes, who work the trains
in and out with extraordinary precision and regularity.</p>
<p>The inside of a signal-box reminds one of a pianoforte on a
large scale, the lever-handles corresponding with the keys of the
instrument; and, to an uninstructed person, to work the one would
be as difficult as to play a tune on the other.&nbsp; The
signal-box outside Cannon Street Station contains 67
lever-handles, by means of which the signalmen are enabled at the
same moment to communicate with the drivers of all the engines on
the line within an area of 800 yards.&nbsp; They direct by signs,
which are quite as intelligible as words, the drivers of the
trains starting from inside the station, as well as those of the
trains arriving from outside.&nbsp; By pulling a lever-handle, a
distant signal, perhaps out of sight, is set some hundred yards
off, which the approaching driver&mdash;reading it quickly as he
comes along&mdash;at once interprets, and stops or advances as
the signal may direct.</p>
<p>The precision and accuracy of the signal-machinery employed at
important stations and junctions have of late years been much
improved by an ingenious contrivance, by means of which the
setting of the signal prepares the road for the coming
train.&nbsp; When the signal is set at &ldquo;Danger,&rdquo; the
points are at the same time worked, and <!-- page xv--><a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>the road is
&ldquo;locked&rdquo; against it; and when at
&ldquo;Safety,&rdquo; the road is open,&mdash;the signal and the
points exactly corresponding.</p>
<p>The Electric Telegraph has also been found a valuable
auxiliary in ensuring the safe working of large railway
traffics.&nbsp; Though the locomotive may run at 60 miles an
hour, electricity, when at its fastest, travels at the rate of
288,000 miles a second, and is therefore always able to herald
the coming train.&nbsp; The electric telegraph may, indeed, be
regarded as the nervous system of the railway.&nbsp; By its means
the whole line is kept throbbing with intelligence.&nbsp; The
method of working the electric signals varies on different lines;
but the usual practice is, to divide a line into so many lengths,
each protected by its signal-stations,&mdash;the fundamental law
of telegraph-working being, that two engines are not to be
allowed to run on the same line between two signal-stations at
the same time.</p>
<p>When a train passes one of such stations, it is immediately
signalled on&mdash;usually by electric signal-bells&mdash;to the
station in advance, and that interval of railway is
&ldquo;blocked&rdquo; until the signal has been received from the
station in advance that the train has passed it.&nbsp; Thus an
interval of space is always secured between trains following each
other, which are thereby alike protected before and behind.&nbsp;
And thus, when a train starts on a journey, it may be of hundreds
of miles, it is signalled on from station to station&mdash;it
&ldquo;lives along the line,&rdquo;&mdash;until at length it
reaches its destination and the last signal of &ldquo;train
in&rdquo; is given.&nbsp; By this means an immense number of
trains can be worked with regularity and safety.&nbsp; On <!--
page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvi</span>the South-Eastern Railway, where the system has been
brought to a state of high efficiency, it is no unusual thing
during Easter week to send 600,000 passengers through the London
Bridge Station alone; and on some days as many as 1200 trains
a-day.</p>
<p>While such are the expedients adopted to ensure safety, others
equally ingenious are adopted to ensure speed.&nbsp; In the case
of express and mail trains, the frequent stopping of the engines
to take in a fresh supply of water occasions a considerable loss
of time on a long journey, each stoppage for this purpose
occupying from ten to fifteen minutes.&nbsp; To avoid such
stoppages, larger tenders have been provided, capable of carrying
as much as 2000 gallons of water each.&nbsp; But as a
considerable time is occupied in filling these, a plan has been
contrived by Mr. Ramsbottom, the Locomotive Engineer of the
London and North-Western Railway, by which the engines are made
to <i>feed themselves</i> while running at full speed!&nbsp; The
plan is as follows:&mdash;An open trough, about 440 feet long, is
laid longitudinally between the rails.&nbsp; Into this trough,
which is filled with water, a dip-pipe or scoop attached to the
bottom of the tender of the running train is lowered; and, at a
speed of 50 miles an hour, as much as 1070 gallons of water are
scooped up in the course of a few minutes.&nbsp; The first of
such troughs was laid down between Chester and Holyhead, to
enable the Express Mail to run the distance of 841 miles in two
hours and five minutes without stopping; and similar troughs have
since been laid down at Bushey near London, at Castlethorpe near
Wolverton, and at Parkside near Liverpool.&nbsp; At these four
troughs about 130,000 gallons of water are scooped up daily.</p>
<p><!-- page xvii--><a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>Wherever railways have been made,
new towns have sprung up, and old towns and cities been quickened
into new life.&nbsp; When the first English lines were projected,
great were the prophecies of disaster to the inhabitants of the
districts through which they were proposed to be forced.&nbsp;
Such fears have long since been dispelled in this country.&nbsp;
The same prejudices existed in France.&nbsp; When the railway
from Paris to Marseilles was laid out so as to pass through
Lyons, a local prophet predicted that if the line were made the
city would be ruined&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ville travers&eacute;e</i>,
<i>ville perdue</i>;&rdquo; while a local priest denounced the
locomotive and the electric telegraph as heralding <i>the reign
of Antichrist</i>.&nbsp; But such nonsense is no longer
uttered.&nbsp; Now it is the city without the railway that is
regarded as the &ldquo;city lost;&rdquo; for it is in a measure
shut out from the rest of the world, and left outside the pale of
civilisation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of all the illustrations that could
be offered of the extent to which railways facilitate the
locomotion, the industry, and the subsistence of the population
of large towns and cities, is afforded by the working of the
railway system in connection with the capital of Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The extension of railways to London has been of comparatively
recent date; the whole of the lines connecting it with the
provinces and terminating at its outskirts, having been opened
during the last thirty years, while the lines inside London have
for the most part been opened within the last sixteen years.</p>
<p>The first London line was the Greenwich Railway, part of which
was opened for traffic to Deptford in February 1836.&nbsp; The
working of this railway was first exhibited as <!-- page
xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>a show, and the usual attractions were employed to
make it &ldquo;draw.&rdquo;&nbsp; A band of musicians in the garb
of the Beef-eaters was stationed at the London end, and another
band at Deptford.&nbsp; For cheapness&rsquo; sake the Deptford
band was shortly superseded by a large barrel-organ, which played
in the passengers; but, when the traffic became established, the
barrel organ, as well as the beef-eater band at the London end,
were both discontinued.&nbsp; The whole length of the line was
lit up at night by a row of lamps on either side like a street,
as if to enable the locomotives or the passengers to see their
way in the dark; but these lamps also were eventually
discontinued as unnecessary.</p>
<p>As a show, the Greenwich Railway proved tolerably
successful.&nbsp; During the first eleven months it carried
456,750 passengers, or an average of about 1300 a-day.&nbsp; But
the railway having been found more convenient to the public than
either the river boats or the omnibuses, the number of passengers
rapidly increased.&nbsp; When the Croydon, Brighton, and
South-Eastern Railways began to pour their streams of traffic
over the Greenwich viaduct, its accommodation was found much too
limited; and it was widened from time to time, until now nine
lines of railway are laid side by side, over which more than
twenty millions of passengers are carried yearly, or an average
of about 60,000 a day all the year round.</p>
<p>Since the partial opening of the Greenwich Railway in 1836, a
large extent of railways has been constructed in and about the
metropolis, and convenient stations have been established almost
in the heart of the City.&nbsp; Sixteen of these stations are
within a circle of half a mile radius from the Mansion House, and
above three hundred stations <!-- page xix--><a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>are in
actual use within about five miles of Charing Cross.</p>
<p>To accommodate this vast traffic, not fewer than 3600 local
trains are run in and out daily, besides 340 trains which depart
to and arrive from distant places, north, south, east, and
west.&nbsp; In the morning hours, between 8.30 and 10.30, when
business men are proceeding inwards to their offices and
counting-houses, and in the afternoon between four and six, when
they are returning outwards to their homes, as many as two
thousand stoppages are made in the hour, within the metropolitan
district, for the purpose of taking up and setting down
passengers, while about two miles of railway are covered by the
running trains.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable effects of railways has been to extend
the residential area of all large towns and cities.&nbsp; This is
especially notable in the case of London.&nbsp; Before the
introduction of railways, the residential area of the metropolis
was limited by the time occupied by business men in making the
journey outwards and inwards daily; and it was for the most part
bounded by Bow on the east, by Hampstead and Highgate on the
north, by Paddington and Kensington on the west, and by Clapham
and Brixton on the south.&nbsp; But now that stations have been
established near the centre of the city, and places so distant as
Waltham, Barnet, Watford, Hanwell, Richmond, Epsom, Croydon,
Reigate, and Erith, can be more quickly reached by rail than the
old suburban quarters were by omnibus, the metropolis has become
extended in all directions along its railway lines, and the
population of London, instead of living in the City or its
immediate vicinity, as formerly, <!-- page xx--><a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>have come to
occupy a residential area of not less than six hundred square
miles!</p>
<p>The number of new towns which have consequently sprung into
existence near London within the last twenty years has been very
great; towns numbering from ten to twenty thousand inhabitants,
which before were but villages,&mdash;if, indeed, they
existed.&nbsp; This has especially been the case along the lines
south of the Thames, principally in consequence of the termini of
those lines being more conveniently situated for city men of
business.&nbsp; Hence the rapid growth of the suburban towns up
and down the river, from Richmond and Staines on the west, to
Erith and Gravesend on the east, and the hives of population
which have settled on the high grounds south of the Thames, in
the neighbourhood of Norwood and the Crystal Palace, rapidly
spreading over the Surrey Downs, from Wimbledon to Guildford, and
from Bromley to Croydon, Epsom, and Dorking.&nbsp; And now that
the towns on the south and south-east coast can be reached by
city men in little more time than it takes to travel to Clapham
or Bayswater by omnibus, such places have become as it were parts
of the great metropolis, and Brighton and Hastings are but the
marine suburbs of London.</p>
<p>The improved state of the communications of the City with the
country has had a marked effect upon its population.&nbsp; While
the action of the railways has been to add largely to the number
of persons living in London, it has also been accompanied by
their dispersion over a much larger area.&nbsp; Thus the
population of the central parts of London is constantly
decreasing, whereas that of the suburban districts is as
constantly increasing.&nbsp; The population <!-- page xxi--><a
name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>of the City
fell off more than 10,000 between 1851 and 1861; and during the
same period, that of Holborn, the Strand, St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields, St. James&rsquo;s, Westminster,
East and West London, showed a considerable decrease.&nbsp; But,
as regards the whole mass of the metropolitan population, the
increase has been enormous.&nbsp; Thus, starting from 1801, when
the population of London was 958,863, we find it increasing in
each decennial period at the rate of between two and three
hundred thousand, until the year 1841, when it amounted to
1,948,369.&nbsp; Railways had by that time reached London, after
which its population increased at nearly double the former
ratio.&nbsp; In the ten years ending 1851, the increase was
513,867; and in the ten years ending 1861, 441,753: until now, to
quote the words of the Registrar-General in a recent annual
Report, &ldquo;the population within the registration limits is
by estimate 2,993,513; but beyond this central mass there is a
ring of life growing rapidly, and extending along railway lines
over a circle of fifteen miles from Charing Cross.&nbsp; The
population within that circle, patrolled by the metropolitan
police, is about 3,463,771&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The aggregation of so vast a number of persons within so
comparatively limited an area&mdash;the immense quantity of food
required for their daily sustenance, as well as of fuel,
clothing, and other necessaries&mdash;would be attended with no
small inconvenience and danger, but for the facilities again
provided by the railways.&nbsp; The provisioning of a garrison of
even four thousand men is considered a formidable affair; how
much more so the provisioning of nearly four millions of
people!</p>
<p>The whole mystery is explained by the admirable <!-- page
xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>organisation of the railway service, and the
regularity and despatch with which it is conducted.&nbsp; We are
enabled by the courtesy of the General Managers of the London
railways to bring together the following brief summary of facts
relating to the food supply of London, which will probably be
regarded by most readers as of a very remarkable character.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the railways to the south of the Thames
contribute comparatively little towards the feeding of
London.&nbsp; They are, for the most part passenger and
residential lines, traversing a limited and not very fertile
district bounded by the sea-coast; and, excepting in fruit and
vegetables, milk and hops, they probably carry more food from
London than they bring to it.&nbsp; The principal supplies of
grain, flour, potatoes, and fish, are brought by railway from the
eastern counties of England and Scotland; and of cattle and
sheep, beef and mutton, from the grazing counties of the west and
north-west of Britain, as far as the Highlands of Scotland, which
have, through the instrumentality of railways, become part of the
great grazing grounds of the metropolis.</p>
<p>Take first &ldquo;the staff of life&rdquo;&mdash;bread and its
constituents.&nbsp; Of wheat, not less than 222,080 quarters were
brought into London by railway in 1867, besides what was brought
by sea; of oats 151,757 quarters; of barley 70,282 quarters; of
beans and peas 51,448 quarters.&nbsp; Of the wheat and barley, by
far the largest proportion is brought by the Great Eastern
Railway, which delivers in London in one year 155,000 quarters of
wheat and 45,500 quarters of barley, besides 600,429 quarters
more in the form of malt.&nbsp; The largest quantity of oats is
brought by the Great <!-- page xxiii--><a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>Northern Railway, principally from the north of
England and the East of Scotland,&mdash;the quantity delivered by
that Company in 1867 having been 97,500 quarters, besides 24,664
quarters of wheat, 5560 quarters of barley, and 103,917 quarters
of malt.&nbsp; Again, of 1,250,566 sacks of flour and meal
delivered in London in one year, the Great Eastern brings 654,000
sacks, the Great Northern 232,022 sacks, and the Great Western
136,312 sacks; the principal contribution of the London and
North-Western Railway towards the London bread-stores being
100,760 boxes of American flour, besides 24,300 sacks of
English.&nbsp; The total quantity of malt delivered at the London
railway stations in 1867 was thirteen hundred thousand sacks.</p>
<p>Next, as to flesh meat.&nbsp; In 1867, not fewer than 172,300
head of cattle were brought to London by railway,&mdash;though
this was considerably less than the number carried before the
cattle-plague, the Great Eastern Railway alone having carried
44,672 less than in 1864.&nbsp; But this loss has since been more
than made up by the increased quantities of fresh beef, mutton,
and other kinds of meat imported in lieu of the live
animals.&nbsp; The principal supplies of cattle are brought, as
we have said, by the Western, Northern, and Eastern lines: by the
Great Western from the western counties and Ireland; by the
London and North-Western, the Midland, and the Great Northern
from the northern counties and from Scotland; and by the Great
Eastern from the eastern counties and from the ports of Harwich
and Lowestoft.</p>
<p>In 1867, also, 1,147,609 sheep were brought to London by
railway, of which the Great Eastern delivered not less <!-- page
xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>than 265,371 head.&nbsp; The London and North-Western
and Great Northern between them brought 390,000 head from the
northern English counties, with a large proportion from the
Scotch Highlands.&nbsp; While the Great Western brought up
130,000 head from the Welsh mountains and from the rich grazing
districts of Wilts, Gloucester, Somerset, and Devon.&nbsp;
Another important freight of the London and North-Western Railway
consists of pigs, of which they delivered 54,700 in London,
principally Irish; while the Great Eastern brought up 27,500 of
the same animal, partly foreign.</p>
<p>While the cattle-plague had the effect of greatly reducing the
number of live stock brought into London yearly, it gave a
considerable impetus to the Fresh Meat traffic.&nbsp; Thus, in
addition to the above large numbers of cattle and sheep delivered
in London in 1867, the railways brought 76,175 tons of meat,
which&mdash;taking the meat of an average beast at 800 lbs., and
of an average sheep at 64 lbs.&mdash;would be equivalent to about
112,000 more cattle, and 1,267,500 more sheep.&nbsp; The Great
Northern brought the largest quantity; next the London and
North-Western;&mdash;these two Companies having brought up
between them, from distances as remote as Aberdeen and Inverness,
about 42,000 tons of fresh meat in 1867, at an average freight of
about &frac12;d. a lb.</p>
<p>Again as regards Fish, of which six-tenths of the whole
quantity consumed in London is now brought by rail.&nbsp; The
Great Eastern and the Great Northern are by far the largest
importers of this article, and justify their claim to be regarded
as the great food lines of London.&nbsp; Of the 61,358 tons of
fish brought by railway in 1867, not less <!-- page xxv--><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>than 24,500
tons were delivered by the former, and 22,000 tons, brought from
much longer distances, by the latter Company.&nbsp; The London
and North-Western brought about 6000 tons, the principal part of
which was salmon from Scotland and Ireland.&nbsp; The Great
Western also brought about 4000 tons, partly salmon, but the
greater part mackerel from the south-west coast.&nbsp; During the
mackerel season, as much as a hundred tons at a time are brought
into the Paddington Station by express fish-train from
Cornwall.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies are also the
principal carriers of turkeys, geese, fowls, and game; the
quantity delivered in London by the former Company having been
5042 tons.&nbsp; In Christmas week no fewer than 30,000 turkeys
and geese were delivered at the Bishopsgate Station, besides
about 300 tons of poultry, 10,000 barrels of beer, and immense
quantities of fish, oysters, and other kinds of food.&nbsp; As
much as 1600 tons of poultry and game were brought last year by
the South-Western Railway; 600 tons by the Great Northern
Railway; and 130 tons of turkeys, geese, and fowls, by the
London, Chatham and Dover line, principally from France.</p>
<p>Of miscellaneous articles, the Great Northern and the Midland
each brought about 3000 tons of cheese, the South-Western 2600
tons, and the London and North-Western 10,034 cheeses in number;
while the South-Western and Brighton lines brought a splendid
contribution to the London breakfast-table in the shape of 11,259
<i>tons</i> of French eggs; these two Companies delivering
between them an average of more than three millions of <!-- page
xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>eggs a week all the year round!&nbsp; The same
Companies delivered in London 14,819 tons of butter, for the most
part the produce of the farms of Normandy,&mdash;the greater
cleanness and neatness with which the Normandy butter is prepared
for market rendering it a favourite both with dealers and
consumers of late years compared with Irish butter.&nbsp; The
London, Chatham and Dover Company also brought from Calais 96
tons of eggs.</p>
<p>Next, as to the potatoes, vegetables, and fruit, brought by
rail.&nbsp; Forty years since, the inhabitants of London relied
for their supply of vegetables on the garden-grounds in the
immediate neighbourhood of the metropolis, and the consequence
was that they were both very dear and limited in quantity.&nbsp;
But railways, while they have extended the grazing-grounds of
London as far as the Highlands, have at the same time extended
the garden-grounds of London into all the adjoining
counties&mdash;into East Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, the
vale of Gloucester, and even as far as Penzance in
Cornwall.&nbsp; The London, Chatham and Dover, one of the
youngest of our main lines, brought up from East Kent in 1867
5279 tons of potatoes, 1046 tons of vegetables, and 5386 tons of
fruit, besides 542 tons of vegetables from France.&nbsp; The
South-Eastern brought 25,163 tons of the same produce.&nbsp; The
Great Eastern brought from the eastern counties 21,315 tons of
potatoes, and 3596 tons of vegetables and fruit; while the Great
Northern brought no less than 78,505 tons of potatoes&mdash;a
large part of them from the east of Scotland&mdash;and 3768 tons
of vegetables and fruit.&nbsp; About 6000 tons of early potatoes
were brought from Cornwall, with about 5000 tons of broccoli, and
the quantities are steadily <!-- page xxvii--><a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvii</span>increasing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly London hath a large
belly,&rdquo; said old Fuller, two hundred years since.&nbsp; But
how much more capacious is it now!</p>
<p>One of the most striking illustrations of the utility of
railways in contributing to the supply of wholesome articles of
food to the population of large cities, is to be found in the
rapid growth of the traffic in Milk.&nbsp; Readers of newspapers
may remember the descriptions published some years since of the
horrid dens in which London cows were penned, and of the odious
compound sold by the name of milk, of which the least deleterious
ingredient in it was supplied by the &ldquo;cow with the iron
tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; That state of affairs is now completely
changed.&nbsp; What with the greatly improved state of the London
dairies and the better quality of the milk supplied by them,
together with the large quantities brought by railway from a
range of a hundred miles and more all round London, even the
poorest classes in the metropolis are now enabled to obtain as
wholesome a supply of the article as the inhabitants of most
country towns.</p>
<p>These great streams of food, which we have thus so summarily
described, flow into London so continuously and uninterruptedly,
that comparatively few persons are aware of the magnitude and
importance of the process thus daily going forward.&nbsp; Though
gathered from an immense extent of country&mdash;embracing
England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland&mdash;the influx is so
unintermitted that it is relied upon with as much certainty as if
it only came from the counties immediately adjoining
London.&nbsp; The express meat-train from Aberdeen arrives in
town as punctually as the Clapham omnibus, and the express <!--
page xxviii--><a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>milk-train from Aylesbury is as regular in its
delivery as the penny post.&nbsp; Indeed London now depends so
much upon railways for its subsistence, that it may be said to be
fed by them from day to day, having never more than a few
days&rsquo; food in stock.&nbsp; And the supply is so regular and
continuous, that the possibility of its being interrupted never
for a moment occurs to any one.&nbsp; Yet in these days of
strikes amongst workmen, such a contingency is quite within the
limits of possibility.&nbsp; Another contingency, which might
arise during a state of war, is probably still more remote.&nbsp;
But were it possible for a war to occur between England and a
combination of foreign powers possessed of stronger ironclads
than ours, and that they were able to ram our ships back into
port and land an enemy of overpowering force on the Essex coast,
it would be sufficient for them to occupy or cut the railways
leading from the north, to starve London into submission in less
than a fortnight.</p>
<p>Besides supplying London with food, railways have also been
instrumental in ensuring the more regular and economical supply
of fuel,&mdash;a matter of almost as vital importance to the
population in a climate such as that of England.&nbsp; So long as
the market was supplied with coal brought by sea in sailing
ships, fuel in winter often rose to a famine price, especially
during long-continued easterly winds.&nbsp; But now that railways
are in full work, the price is almost as steady in winter as in
summer, and (but for strikes) the supply is more regular at all
seasons.</p>
<p>But the carriage of food and fuel to London forms but a small
part of the merchandise traffic carried by railway.&nbsp; Above
600,000 tons of goods of various kinds yearly pass <!-- page
xxix--><a name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxix</span>through one station only, that of the London and
North-Western Company, at Camden Town; and sometimes as many as
20,000 parcels daily.&nbsp; Every other metropolitan station is
similarly alive with traffic inwards and outwards, London having
since the introduction of railways become more than ever a great
distributive centre, to which merchandise of all kinds converges,
and from which it is distributed to all parts of the
country.&nbsp; Mr. Bazley, M.P., stated at a late public meeting
at Manchester, that it would probably require ten millions of
horses to convey by road the merchandise traffic which is now
annually carried by railway.</p>
<p>Railways have also proved of great value in connection with
the Cheap Postage system.&nbsp; By their means it has become
possible to carry letters, newspapers, books and post parcels, in
any quantity, expeditiously, and cheaply.&nbsp; The Liverpool and
Manchester line was no sooner opened in 1830, than the Post
Office authorities recognised its utility, and used it for
carrying the mails between the two towns.&nbsp; When the London
and Birmingham line was opened eight years later, mail trains
were at once put on,&mdash;the directors undertaking to perform
the distance of 113 miles within 5 hours by day and 5&frac12;
hours by night.&nbsp; As additional lines were opened, the old
four-horse mail coaches were gradually discontinued, until in
1858, the last of them, the &ldquo;Derby Dilly,&rdquo; which ran
between Manchester and Derby, was taken off on the opening of the
Midland line to Rowsley.</p>
<p>The increased accommodation provided by railways was found of
essential importance, more particularly after the adoption of the
Cheap Postage system; and that such <!-- page xxx--><a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxx</span>accommodation was needed will be obvious from the
extraordinary increase which has taken place in the number of
letters and packets sent by post.&nbsp; Thus, in 1839, the number
of chargeable letters carried was only 76 millions, and of
newspapers 44&frac12; millions; whereas, in 1865, the numbers of
letters had increased to 720 millions, and in 1867 to 775
millions, or more than ten-fold, while the number of newspapers,
books, samples and patterns (a new branch of postal business
began in 1864) had increased, in 1865, to 98&frac12;
millions.</p>
<p>To accommodate this largely-increasing traffic, the bulk of
which is carried by railway, the mileage run by mail trains in
the United Kingdom has increased from 25,000 miles a day in 1854
(the first year of which we have any return of the mileage run)
to 60,000 miles a day in 1867, or an increase of 240 per
cent.&nbsp; The Post Office expenditure on railway service has
also increased, but not in like proportion, having been
&pound;364,000 in the former year, and &pound;559,575 in the
latter, or an increase of 154 per cent.&nbsp; The revenue, gross
and net, has increased still more rapidly.&nbsp; In 1841, the
first complete year of the Cheap Postage system, the gross
revenue was &pound;1,359,466 and the net revenue &pound;500,789;
in 1854, the gross revenue was &pound;2,574,407, and the net
revenue &pound;1,173,723; and in 1867, the gross revenue was
&pound;4,548,129, and the net revenue &pound;2,127,125, being an
increase of 420 per cent. compared with 1841, and of 180 per
cent. compared with 1854.&nbsp; How much of this net increase
might fairly be credited to the Railway Postal service we shall
not pretend to say; but assuredly the proportion must be very
considerable.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of railways in connection <!--
page xxxi--><a name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>with the postal service is the greatly increased
frequency of communication which they provide between all the
large towns.&nbsp; Thus Liverpool has now six deliveries of
Manchester letters daily; while every large town in the kingdom
has two or more deliveries of London letters daily.&nbsp; In
1863, 393 towns had two mails daily from London; 50 had three
mails daily; 7 had four mails a day <i>from</i> London, and 15
had four mails a day <i>to</i> London; while 3 towns had five
mails a day <i>from</i> London, and 6 had five mails a day
<i>to</i> London.</p>
<p>Another feature of the railway mail train, as of the passenger
train, is its capacity to carry any quantity of letters and post
parcels that may require to be carried.&nbsp; In 1838, the
aggregate weight of all the evening mails despatched from London
by twenty-eight mail coaches was 4 tons 6 cwt., or an average of
about 3&frac14; cwt. each, though the maximum contract weight was
15 cwt.&nbsp; The mails now are necessarily much heavier, the
number of letters and packets having, as we have seen, increased
more than ten-fold since 1839.&nbsp; But it is not the ordinary
so much as the extraordinary mails that are of considerable
weight,&mdash;more particularly the American, the Continental,
and the Australian mails.&nbsp; It is no unusual thing, we are
informed, for the last-mentioned mail to weigh as much as 40
tons.&nbsp; How many of the old mail coaches it would take to
carry such a mail the 79 miles journey to Southampton, with a
relay of four horses every five or seven miles, is a problem for
the arithmetician to solve.&nbsp; But even supposing each coach
to be loaded to the maximum weight of 15 cwt. per coach, it would
require about sixty vehicles and about 1700 horses to carry the
40 tons, besides the coachman and guards.</p>
<p><!-- page xxxii--><a name="pagexxxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>Whatever may be said of the
financial management of railways, there can be no doubt as to the
great benefits conferred by them on the public wherever
made.&nbsp; Even those railways which have exhibited the most
&ldquo;frightful examples&rdquo; of financing and jobbing, have
been found to prove of unquestionable public convenience and
utility.&nbsp; And notwithstanding all the faults and
imperfections that have been alleged against railways, we think
that they must, nevertheless, be recognised as by far the most
valuable means of communication between men and nations that has
yet been given to the world.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s object in publishing this book in its
original form, was to describe, in connection with the
&lsquo;Life of George Stephenson,&rsquo; the origin and progress
of the railway system,&mdash;to show by what moral and material
agencies its founders were enabled to carry their ideas into
effect, and work out results which even then were of a remarkable
character, though they have since, as above described, become so
much more extraordinary.&nbsp; The favour with which successive
editions of the book have been received, has justified the author
in his anticipation that such a narrative would prove of general,
if not of permanent interest.</p>
<p>The book was written with the concurrence and assistance of
Robert Stephenson, who also supplied the necessary particulars
relating to himself.&nbsp; Such portions of these were
accordingly embodied in the narrative as could with propriety be
published during his lifetime, and the remaining portions have
since been added, with the object of rendering more complete the
record of the son&rsquo;s life as well as of the early history of
the Railway system.</p>

<span class="smcap">Newcastle and the Great Northern
Coal-Field</span>.</h2>
<p>In no quarter of England have greater changes been wrought by
the successive advances made in the practical science of
engineering than in the extensive colliery districts of the
North, of which Newcastle-upon-Tyne is the centre and the
capital.</p>
<p>In ancient times the Romans planted a colony at Newcastle,
throwing a bridge across the Tyne near the site of the low-level
bridge shown in the prefixed engraving, and erecting a strong
fortification above it on the high ground now occupied by the
Central Railway Station.&nbsp; North and north-west lay a wild
country, abounding in moors, mountains, and morasses, but
occupied to a certain extent by fierce and barbarous
tribes.&nbsp; To defend the young colony against their ravages, a
strong wall was built by the Romans, extending from Wallsend on
the north bank of the Tyne, a few miles below Newcastle, across
the country to Burgh-upon-Sands on the Solway Firth.&nbsp; The
remains of the wall are still to be traced in the less populous
hill-districts of Northumberland.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of
Newcastle they have been gradually effaced by the works of
succeeding generations, though the &ldquo;Wallsend&rdquo; coal
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>consumed in our household fires still serves to remind us
of the great Roman work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Romans, Northumbria became planted
by immigrant Saxons from North Germany and Norsemen from
Scandinavia, whose Eorls or Earls made Newcastle their principal
seat.&nbsp; Then came the Normans, from whose <i>New</i> Castle,
built some eight hundred years since, the town derived its
present name.&nbsp; The keep of this venerable structure, black
with age and smoke, still stands entire at the northern end of
the noble high-level bridge&mdash;the utilitarian work of modern
times thus confronting the warlike relic of the older
civilisation.</p>
<p>The nearness of Newcastle to the Scotch Border was a great
hindrance to its security and progress in the middle ages of
English history.&nbsp; Indeed, the district between it and
Berwick continued to be ravaged by moss-troopers long after the
union of the Crowns.&nbsp; The gentry lived in their strong Peel
castles; even the larger farm-houses were fortified; and
bloodhounds were trained for the purpose of tracking the
cattle-reavers to their retreats in the hills.&nbsp; The Judges
of Assize rode from Carlisle to Newcastle guarded by an escort
armed to the teeth.&nbsp; A tribute called <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>&ldquo;dagger
and protection money&rdquo; was annually paid by the Sheriff of
Newcastle for the purpose of providing daggers and other weapons
for the escort; and, though the need of such protection has long
since ceased, the tribute continues to be paid in broad gold
pieces of the time of Charles the First.</p>
<p>Until about the middle of last century the roads across
Northumberland were little better than horse-tracks, and not many
years since the primitive agricultural cart with solid wooden
wheels was almost as common in the western parts of the county as
it is in Spain now.&nbsp; The tract of the old Roman road
continued to be the most practicable route between Newcastle and
Carlisle, the traffic between the two towns having been carried
along it upon packhorses until a comparatively recent period.</p>
<p>Since that time great changes have taken place on the
Tyne.&nbsp; When wood for firing became scarce and dear, and the
forests of the South of England were found inadequate to supply
the increasing demand for fuel, attention was turned to the rich
stores of coal lying underground in the neighbourhood of
Newcastle and Durham.&nbsp; It then became an article of
increasing export, and &ldquo;seacoal&rdquo; fires gradually
supplanted those of wood.&nbsp; Hence an old writer described
Newcastle as &ldquo;the Eye of the North, and the Hearth that
warmeth the South parts of this kingdom with Fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fuel has become the staple product of the district, the quantity
exported increasing from year to year, until the coal raised from
these northern mines amounts to upwards of sixteen millions of
tons a year, of which not less than nine millions are annually
conveyed away by sea.</p>
<p>Newcastle has in the mean time spread in all directions far
beyond its ancient boundaries.&nbsp; From a walled medi&aelig;val
town of monks and merchants, it has been converted into a busy
centre of commerce and manufactures inhabited by nearly 100,000
people.&nbsp; It is no longer a Border fortress&mdash;a
&ldquo;shield and defence against the invasions and frequent
insults of the Scots,&rdquo; as described in ancient
charters&mdash;but <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>a busy centre of peaceful industry,
and the outlet for a vast amount of steam-power, which is
exported in the form of coal to all parts of the world.&nbsp;
Newcastle is in many respects a town of singular and curious
interest, especially in its older parts, which are full of
crooked lanes and narrow streets, wynds, and chares, <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> formed by tall, antique houses, rising
tier above tier along the steep northern bank of the Tyne, as the
similarly precipitous streets of Gateshead crowd the opposite
shore.</p>
<p>All over the coal region, which extends from the Coquet to the
Tees, about fifty miles from north to south, the surface of the
soil exhibits the signs of extensive underground workings.&nbsp;
As you pass through the country at night, the earth looks as if
it were bursting with fire at many points; the blaze of
coke-ovens, iron-furnaces, and coal-heaps reddening the sky to
such a distance that the horizon seems to be a glowing belt of
fire.</p>
<p>From the necessity which existed for facilitating the
transport of coals from the pits to the shipping places, it is
easy to understand how the railway and the locomotive should have
first found their home in such a district as we have thus briefly
described.&nbsp; At an early period the coal was carried to the
boats in panniers, or in sacks upon horses&rsquo; backs.&nbsp;
Then carts were used, to facilitate the progress of which
tramways of flag-stone were laid down.&nbsp; This led to the
enlargement of the vehicle, which became known as a waggon, and
it was mounted on four wheels instead of two.&nbsp; A local
writer about the middle of the seventeenth century says,
&ldquo;Many thousand people are engaged in this trade of coals;
many live by working of <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>them in the pits; and many live by
conveying them in waggons and wains to the river Tyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still further to facilitate the haulage of the waggons, pieces
of planking were laid parallel upon wooden sleepers, or imbedded
in the ordinary track, by which friction was still further
diminished.&nbsp; It is said that these wooden rails were first
employed by one Beaumont, about 1630; and on a road thus laid, a
single horse was capable of drawing a large loaded waggon from
the coal-pit to the shipping staith.&nbsp; Roger North, in 1676,
found the practice had become extensively adopted, and he speaks
of the large sums then paid for way-leaves; that is, the
permission granted by the owners of lands lying between the
coal-pit and the river-side to lay down a tramway between the one
and the other.&nbsp; A century later, Arthur Young observed that
not only had these roads become greatly multiplied, but important
works had been constructed to carry them along upon the same
level.&nbsp; &ldquo;The coal-waggon roads from the pits to the
water,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are great works, carried over all
sorts of inequalities of ground, so far as the distance of nine
or ten miles.&nbsp; The tracks of the wheels are marked with
pieces of wood let into the road for the wheels of the waggons to
run on, by which one horse is enabled to draw, and that with
ease, fifty or sixty bushels of coals.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>Similar waggon-roads were laid down in the coal districts of
Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland.&nbsp; At the time of the Scotch
rebellion in 1745, a tramroad existed between the Tranent
coal-pits and the small harbour of Cockenzie in East Lothian; and
a portion of the line was selected by General Cope as a position
for his cannon at the battle of Prestonpans.</p>
<p>In these rude wooden tracks we find the germ of the modern
railroad.&nbsp; Improvements were gradually made in them.&nbsp;
Thus, at some collieries, thin plates of iron were nailed upon
their upper surface, for the purpose of <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>protecting the
parts most exposed to friction.&nbsp; Cast-iron rails were also
tried, the wooden rails having been found liable to rot.&nbsp;
The first rails of this kind are supposed to have been used at
Whitehaven as early as 1738.&nbsp; This cast-iron road was
denominated a &ldquo;plate-way,&rdquo; from the plate-like form
in which the rails were cast.&nbsp; In 1767, as appears from the
books of the Coalbrookdale Iron Works, in Shropshire, five or six
tons of rails were cast, as an experiment, on the suggestion of
Mr. Reynolds, one of the partners; and they were shortly after
laid down to form a road.</p>
<p>In 1776, a cast-iron tramway, nailed to wooden sleepers, was
laid down at the Duke of Norfolk&rsquo;s colliery near
Sheffield.&nbsp; The person who designed and constructed this
coal line was Mr. John Curr, whose son has erroneously claimed
for him the invention of the cast-iron railway.&nbsp; He
certainly adopted it early, and thereby met the fate of men
before their age; for his plan was opposed by the labouring
people of the colliery, who got up a riot in which they tore up
the road and burnt the coal-staith, whilst Mr. Curr fled into a
neighbouring wood for concealment, and lay there <i>perdu</i> for
three days and nights, to escape the fury of the populace.&nbsp;
The plates of these early tramways had a ledge cast on their edge
to guide the wheel along the road, after the manner shown in the
annexed cut.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p6.jpg">
<img alt=

src="images/p6.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In 1789, Mr. William Jessop constructed a railway at
Loughborough, in Leicestershire, and there introduced the
cast-iron edge-rail, with flanches cast upon the tire of the
waggon-wheels to keep them on the track, instead of having the
margin or flanch cast upon the rail itself; and this plan was
shortly after adopted in other places.&nbsp; In 1800, Mr.
Benjamin Outram, of Little Eaton, in Derbyshire (father of <!--
page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the
distinguished General Outram), used stone props instead of timber
for supporting the ends or joinings of the rails.&nbsp; Thus the
use of railroads, in various forms, gradually extended, until
they were found in general use all over the mining districts.</p>
<p>Such was the growth of the railway, which, it will be
observed, originated in necessity, and was modified according to
experience; progress in this, as in all departments of mechanics,
having been effected by the exertions of many men, one generation
entering upon the labours of that which preceded it, and carrying
them onward to further stages of improvement.&nbsp; We shall
afterwards find that the invention of the locomotive was made by
like successive steps.&nbsp; It was not the invention of one man,
but of a succession of men, each working at the proper hour, and
according to the needs of that hour; one inventor interpreting
only the first word of the problem which his successors were to
solve after long and laborious efforts and experiments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The locomotive is not the invention of one man,&rdquo;
said Robert Stephenson at Newcastle, &ldquo;but of a nation of
mechanical engineers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same circumstances which led to the rapid extension of
railways in the coal districts of the north tended to direct the
attention of the mining engineers to the early development of the
powers of the steam-engine as a useful instrument of motive
power.&nbsp; The necessity which existed for a more effective
method of hauling the coals from the pits to the shipping places
was constantly present to many minds; and the daily pursuits of a
large class of mechanics occupied in the management of steam
power, by which the coal was raised from the pits, and the mines
were pumped clear of water, had the effect of directing their
attention to the same agency as the best means for accomplishing
that object.</p>
<p>Among the upper-ground workmen employed at the coal-pits, the
principal are the firemen, enginemen, and brakes-men, who fire
and work the engines, and superintend the <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>machinery by
means of which the collieries are worked.&nbsp; Previous to the
introduction of the steam-engine the usual machine employed for
the purpose was what is called a &ldquo;gin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gin
consists of a large drum placed horizontally, round which ropes
attached to buckets and corves are wound, which are thus drawn up
or sent down the shafts by a horse travelling in a circular track
or &ldquo;gin race.&rdquo;&nbsp; This method was employed for
drawing up both coals and water, and it is still used for the
same purpose in small collieries; but where the quantity of water
to be raised is great, pumps worked by steam power are called
into requisition.</p>
<p>Newcomen&rsquo;s atmospheric engine was first made use of to
work the pumps; and it continued to be so employed long after the
more powerful and economical condensing engine of Watt had been
invented.&nbsp; In the Newcomen or &ldquo;fire engine,&rdquo; as
it was called, the power is produced by the pressure of the
atmosphere forcing down the piston in the cylinder, on a vacuum
being produced within it by condensation of the contained steam
by means of cold water injection.&nbsp; The piston-rod is
attached to one end of a lever, whilst the pump-rod works in
connexion with the other,&mdash;the hydraulic action employed to
raise the water being exactly similar to that of a common
sucking-pump.</p>
<p>The working of a Newcomen engine was a clumsy and apparently a
very painful process, accompanied by an extraordinary amount of
wheezing, sighing, creaking, and bumping.&nbsp; When the pump
descended, there was heard a plunge, a heavy sigh, and a loud
bump: then, as it rose, and the sucker began to act, there was
heard a croak, a wheeze, another bump, and then a strong rush of
water as it was lifted and poured out.&nbsp; Where engines of a
more powerful and improved description are used, the quantity of
water raised is enormous&mdash;as much as a million and a half
gallons in the twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The pitmen, or &ldquo;the lads belaw,&rdquo; who work out the
coal below ground, are a peculiar class, quite distinct from <!--
page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the
workmen on the surface.&nbsp; They are a people with peculiar
habits, manners, and character, as much as fishermen and sailors,
to whom, indeed, they bear, in some respects, a considerable
resemblance.&nbsp; Some fifty years since they were a much
rougher and worse educated class than they are now; hard workers,
but very wild and uncouth; much given to &ldquo;steeks,&rdquo; or
strikes; and distinguished, in their hours of leisure and on
pay-nights, for their love of cock-fighting, dog-fighting, hard
drinking, and cuddy races.&nbsp; The pay-night was a fortnightly
saturnalia, in which the pitman&rsquo;s character was fully
brought out, especially when the &ldquo;yel&rdquo; was
good.&nbsp; Though earning much higher wages than the ordinary
labouring population of the upper soil, the latter did not mix
nor intermarry with them; so that they were left to form their
own communities, and hence their marked peculiarities as a
class.&nbsp; Indeed, a sort of traditional disrepute seems long
to have clung to the pitmen, arising perhaps from the nature of
their employment, and from the circumstance that the colliers
were among the last classes enfranchised in England, as they were
certainly the last in Scotland, where they continued bondmen down
to the end of last century.&nbsp; The last thirty years, however,
have worked a great improvement in the moral condition of the
Northumbrian pitmen; the abolition of the twelve months&rsquo;
bond to the mine, and the substitution of a month&rsquo;s notice
previous to leaving, having given them greater freedom and
opportunity for obtaining employment; and day-schools and
Sunday-schools, together with the important influences of
railways, have brought them fully up to a level with the other
classes of the labouring population.</p>
<p>The coals, when raised from the pits, are emptied into the
waggons placed alongside, from whence they are sent along the
rails to the staiths erected by the river-side, the waggons
sometimes descending by their own gravity along inclined planes,
the waggoner standing behind to check the speed by means of a
convoy or wooden brake bearing upon the rims <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of the
wheels.&nbsp; Arrived at the staiths, the waggons are emptied at
once into the ships waiting alongside for cargo.&nbsp; Any one
who has sailed down the Tyne from Newcastle Bridge cannot but
have been struck with the appearance of the immense staiths,
constructed of timber, which are erected at short distances from
each other on both sides of the river.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p10.jpg">
<img alt=

"Coal-Staith on the Tyne"
src="images/p10.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But a great deal of the coal shipped from the Tyne comes from
above-bridge, where sea-going craft cannot reach, and is floated
down the river in &ldquo;keels,&rdquo; in which the coals are
sometimes piled up according to convenience when large, or, when
the coal is small or tender, it is conveyed in tubs to prevent
breakage.&nbsp; These keels are of a very ancient
model,&mdash;perhaps the oldest extant in England: they are even
said to be of the same build as those in which the Norsemen
navigated the Tyne centuries ago.&nbsp; The keel is a tubby,
grimy-looking craft, rounded fore and aft, with a single large
square sail, which the keel-bullies, as the Tyne watermen are
called, manage with great dexterity; <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the vessel
being guided by the aid of the &ldquo;swape,&rdquo; or great oar,
which is used as a kind of rudder at the stern of the
vessel.&nbsp; These keelmen are an exceedingly hardy class of
workmen, not by any means so quarrelsome as their designation of
&ldquo;bully&rdquo; would imply&mdash;the word being merely
derived from the obsolete term &ldquo;boolie,&rdquo; or beloved,
an appellation still in familiar use amongst brother workers in
the coal districts.&nbsp; One of the most curious sights upon the
Tyne is the fleet of hundreds of these black-sailed, black-hulled
keels, bringing down at each tide their black cargoes for the
ships at anchor in the deep water at Shields and other parts of
the river below Newcastle.</p>
<p>These preliminary observations will perhaps be sufficient to
explain the meaning of many of the occupations alluded to, and
the phrases employed, in the course of the following narrative,
some of which might otherwise have been comparatively
unintelligible to the general reader.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Wylam and Dewley Burn</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">George Stephenson&rsquo;s Early Years</span>.</h2>
<p>The colliery village of Wylam is situated on the north bank of
the Tyne, about eight miles west of Newcastle.&nbsp; The
Newcastle and Carlisle railway runs along the opposite bank; and
the traveller by that line sees the usual signs of a colliery in
the unsightly pumping-engines surrounded by heaps of ashes,
coal-dust, and slag; whilst a neighbouring iron-furnace in full
blast throws out dense smoke and loud <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>jets of steam
by day and lurid flames at night.&nbsp; These works form the
nucleus of the village, which is almost entirely occupied by
coal-miners and iron-furnacemen.&nbsp; The place is remarkable
for its large population, but not for its cleanness or neatness
as a village; the houses, as in most colliery villages, being the
property of the owners or lessees, who employ them in temporarily
accommodating the workpeople, against whose earnings there is a
weekly set-off for house and coals.&nbsp; About the end of last
century the estate of which Wylam forms part, belonged to Mr.
Blackett, a gentleman of considerable celebrity in coal-mining,
then more generally known as the proprietor of the
&lsquo;Globe&rsquo; newspaper.</p>
<p>There is nothing to interest one in the village itself.&nbsp;
But a few hundred yards from its eastern extremity stands a
humble detached dwelling, which will be interesting to many as
the birthplace of one of the most remarkable men of our
times&mdash;George Stephenson, the Railway Engineer.&nbsp; It is
a common two-storied, red-tiled, rubble house, portioned off into
four labourers&rsquo; apartments.&nbsp; It is known by the name
of High Street House, and was originally so called because it
stands by the side of what used to be the old riding post road or
street between Newcastle and Hexham, along which the post was
carried on horseback within the memory of persons living.</p>
<p>The lower room in the west end of this house was the home of
the Stephenson family; and there George Stephenson was born, the
second of a family of six children, on the 9th of June,
1781.&nbsp; The apartment is now, what it was then, an ordinary
labourer&rsquo;s dwelling,&mdash;its walls are unplastered, its

<p>Robert Stephenson, or &ldquo;Old Bob,&rdquo; as the neighbours
familiarly called him, and his wife Mabel, were a respectable
couple, careful and hard-working.&nbsp; It is said that Robert
Stephenson&rsquo;s father was a Scotchman, and came into England
as a gentleman&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; Mabel, his wife, was <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>the daughter of Robert Carr, a dyer at Ovingham.&nbsp;
When first married, they lived at Walbottle, a village situated
between Wylam and Newcastle, afterwards removing to Wylam, where
Robert was employed as fireman of the old pumping engine at that
colliery.</p>

<p>An old Wylam collier, who remembered George Stephenson&rsquo;s
father, thus described him:&mdash;&ldquo;Geordie&rsquo;s fayther
war like a peer o&rsquo; deals nailed thegither, an&rsquo; a bit
o&rsquo; flesh i&rsquo; th&rsquo; inside; he war as queer as
Dick&rsquo;s hatband&mdash;went thrice aboot, an&rsquo;
wudn&rsquo;t tie.&nbsp; His wife Mabel war a delicat&rsquo;
boddie, an&rsquo; varry flighty.&nbsp; Thay war an honest family,
but sair hadden doon i&rsquo; th&rsquo; world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, the earnings of old Robert did not amount to more than
twelve shillings a week; and, as there were six children to
maintain, the family, during their stay at Wylam, were
necessarily in very straitened circumstances.&nbsp; The
father&rsquo;s wages <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>being barely sufficient, even with
the most rigid economy, for the sustenance of the household,
there was little to spare for clothing, and nothing for
education, so none of the children were sent to school.</p>
<p>Old Robert was a general favourite in the village, especially
amongst the children, whom he was accustomed to draw about him
whilst tending the engine-fire, and feast their young
imaginations with tales of Sinbad the Sailor and Robinson Crusoe,
besides others of his own invention; so that &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s
engine-fire&rdquo; came to be the most popular resort in the
village.&nbsp; Another feature in his character, by which he was
long remembered, was his affection for birds and animals; and he
had many tame favourites of both sorts, which were as fond of
resorting to his engine-fire as the boys and girls
themselves.&nbsp; In the winter time he had usually a flock of
tame robins about him; and they would come hopping familiarly to
his feet to pick up the crumbs which he had saved for them out of
his humble dinner.&nbsp; At his cottage he was rarely without one
or more tame blackbirds, which flew about the house, or in and
out at the door.&nbsp; In summer-time he would go a-birdnesting
with his children; and one day he took his little son George to
see a blackbird&rsquo;s nest for the first time.&nbsp; Holding
him up in his arms, he let the wondering boy peep down, through
the branches held aside for the purpose, into a nest full of
young birds&mdash;a sight which the boy never forgot, but used to
speak of with delight to his intimate friends when he himself had
grown an old man.</p>
<p>The boy George led the ordinary life of working-people&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; He played about the doors; went birdnesting when
he could; and ran errands to the village.&nbsp; He was also an
eager listener, with the other children, to his father&rsquo;s
curious tales; and he early imbibed from him that affection for
birds and animals which continued throughout his life.&nbsp; In
course of time he was promoted to the office of carrying his
father&rsquo;s dinner to him while at work, and it was on such
occasions his great delight to see <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the robins
fed.&nbsp; At home he helped to nurse, and that with a careful
hand, his younger brothers and sisters.&nbsp; One of his duties
was to see that the other children were kept out of the way of
the chaldron waggons, which were then dragged by horses along the
wooden tramroad immediately in front of the cottage-door.&nbsp;
This waggon-way was the first in the northern district on which
the experiment of a locomotive engine was tried.&nbsp; But at the
time of which we speak, the locomotive had scarcely been dreamt
of in England as a practicable working power; horses only were
used to haul the coal; and one of the first sights with which the
boy was familiar was the coal-waggons dragged by them along the
wooden railway at Wylam.</p>
<p>Thus eight years passed; after which, the coal having been
worked out, the old engine, which had grown &ldquo;dismal to look
at,&rdquo; as one of the workmen described it, was pulled down;
and then Robert, having obtained employment as a fireman at the
Dewley Burn Colliery, removed with his family to that
place.&nbsp; Dewley Burn, at this day, consists of a few
old-fashioned low-roofed cottages standing on either side of a
babbling little stream.&nbsp; They are connected by a rustic
wooden bridge, which spans the rift in front of the doors.&nbsp;
In the central one-roomed cottage of this group, on the right
bank, Robert Stephenson lived for a time with his family; the pit
at which he worked standing in the rear of the cottages.</p>
<p>Young though he was, George was now of an age to be able to
contribute something towards the family maintenance; for in a
poor man&rsquo;s house, every child is a burden until his little
hands can be turned to profitable account.&nbsp; That the boy was
shrewd and active, and possessed of a ready mother wit, will be
evident enough from the following incident.&nbsp; One day his
sister Nell went into Newcastle to buy a bonnet; and Geordie went
with her &ldquo;for company.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a draper&rsquo;s
shop in the Bigg Market, Nell found a &ldquo;chip&rdquo; quite to
her mind, but on pricing it, alas! it was found to be fifteen
pence beyond her means, and she left <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the shop very
much disappointed.&nbsp; But Geordie said, &ldquo;Never heed,
Nell; see if I canna win siller enough to buy the bonnet; stand
ye there, till I come back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Away ran the boy and
disappeared amidst the throng of the market, leaving the girl to
wait his return.&nbsp; Long and long she waited, until it grew
dusk, and the market people had nearly all left.&nbsp; She had
begun to despair, and fears crossed her mind that Geordie must
have been run over and killed; when at last up he came running,
almost breathless.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten the siller for
the bonnet, Nell!&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh
Geordie!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but hoo hae ye gotten
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Haudin the gentlemen&rsquo;s
horses!&rdquo; was the exultant reply.&nbsp; The bonnet was
forthwith bought, and the two returned to Dewley happy.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s first regular employment was of a very humble
sort.&nbsp; A widow, named Grace Ainslie, then occupied the
neighbouring farmhouse of Dewley.&nbsp; She kept a number of
cows, and had the privilege of grazing them along the
waggon-road.&nbsp; She needed a boy to herd the cows, to keep
them out of the way of the waggons, and prevent their straying or
trespassing on the neighbours&rsquo; &ldquo;liberties;&rdquo; the
boy&rsquo;s duty was also to bar the gates at night after all the
waggons had passed.&nbsp; George petitioned for this post, and,
to his great joy, he was appointed at the wage of twopence a
day.</p>
<p>It was light employment, and he had plenty of spare time on
his hands, which he spent in birdnesting, making whistles out of
reeds and scrannel straws, and erecting Lilliputian mills in the
little water-streams that ran into the Dewley bog.&nbsp; But his
favourite amusement at this early age was erecting clay engines
in conjunction with his chosen playmate, Bill Thirlwall.&nbsp;
The place is still pointed out where the future engineers made
their first essays in modelling.&nbsp; The boys found the clay
for their engines in the adjoining bog, and the hemlocks which
grew about supplied them with imaginary steam-pipes.&nbsp; They
even proceeded to make a miniature winding-machine in <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>connexion with their engine, and the apparatus was
erected upon a bench in front of the Thirlwalls&rsquo;
cottage.&nbsp; The corves were made out of hollowed corks; the
ropes were supplied by twine; and a few bits of wood gleaned from
the refuse of the carpenter&rsquo;s shop completed their
materials.&nbsp; With this apparatus the boys made a show of
sending the corves down the pit and drawing them up again, much
to the marvel of the pitmen.&nbsp; But some mischievous person
about the place seized the opportunity early one morning of
smashing the fragile machinery, much to the grief of the young
engineers.</p>
<p>As Stephenson grew older and abler to work, he was set to lead
the horses when ploughing, though scarce big enough to stride
across the furrows; and he used afterwards to say that he rode to
his work in the mornings at an hour when most other children of
his age were asleep in their beds.&nbsp; He was also employed to
hoe turnips, and do similar farm-work, for which he was paid the
advanced wage of fourpence a day.&nbsp; But his highest ambition
was to be taken on at the colliery where his father worked; and
he shortly joined his elder brother James there as a
&ldquo;corf-bitter,&rdquo; or &ldquo;picker,&rdquo; to clear the
coal of stones, bats, and dross.&nbsp; His wages were then
advanced to sixpence a day, and afterwards to eightpence when he
was set to drive the gin-horse.</p>
<p>Shortly after, George went to Black Callerton to drive the gin
there; and as that colliery lies about two miles across the
fields from Dewley Burn, he walked that distance early in the
morning to his work, returning home late in the evening.&nbsp;
One of the old residents at Black Callerton, who remembered him
at that time, described him to the author as &ldquo;a grit
growing lad, with bare legs an&rsquo; feet;&rdquo; adding that he
was &ldquo;very quick-witted and full of fun and tricks: indeed,
there was nothing under the sun but he tried to
imitate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was usually foremost also in the sports
and pastimes of youth.</p>
<p>Among his first strongly-developed tastes was the love <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>of birds and animals, which he inherited from his
father.&nbsp; Blackbirds were his special favourites.&nbsp; The
hedges between Dewley and Black Callerton were capital
bird-nesting places; and there was not a nest there that he did
not know of.&nbsp; When the young birds were old enough, he would
bring them home with him, feed them, and teach them to fly about
the cottage unconfined by cages.&nbsp; One of his blackbirds
became so tame, that, after flying about the doors all day, and
in and out of the cottage, it would take up its roost upon the
bed-head at night.&nbsp; And most singular of all, the bird would
disappear in the spring and summer months, when it was supposed
to go into the woods to pair and rear its young, after which it
would reappear at the cottage, and resume its social habits
during the winter.&nbsp; This went on for several years.&nbsp;
George had also a stock of tame rabbits, for which he built a
little house behind the cottage, and for many years he continued
to pride himself upon the superiority of his breed.</p>
<p>After he had driven the gin for some time at Dewley and Black
Callerton, he was taken on as an assistant to his father in
firing the engine at Dewley.&nbsp; This was a step of promotion
which he had anxiously desired, his only fear being lest he
should be found too young for the work.&nbsp; Indeed, he used
afterwards to relate how he was wont to hide himself when the
owner of the colliery went round, in case he should be thought
too little a boy to earn the wages paid him.&nbsp; Since he had
modelled his clay engines in the bog, his young ambition was to
be an engineman; and to be an assistant fireman was the first
step towards this position.&nbsp; Great therefore was his joy
when, at about fourteen years of age, he was appointed
assistant-fireman, at the wage of a shilling a day.</p>
<p>But the coal at Dewley Burn being at length worked out, the
pit was ordered to be &ldquo;laid in,&rdquo; and old Robert and
his family were again under the necessity of shifting their home;
for, to use the common phrase, they must &ldquo;follow the
wark.&rdquo;&nbsp; They removed accordingly to a place <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>called Jolly&rsquo;s Close, a few miles to the south,
close behind the village of Newburn, where another coal-mine
belonging to the Duke of Northumberland, called &ldquo;the
Duke&rsquo;s Winnin,&rdquo; had recently been opened out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>One of the old persons in the neighbourhood, who knew the
family well, describes the dwelling in which they lived as a poor
cottage of only one room, in which the father, mother, four sons,
and two daughters, lived and slept.&nbsp; It was crowded with
three low-poled beds.&nbsp; The one apartment served for parlour,
kitchen, sleeping-room, and all.</p>
<p>The children of the Stephenson family were now growing apace,
and several of them were old enough to be able to earn money at
various kinds of colliery work.&nbsp; James and George, the two
eldest sons, worked as assistant-firemen; <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and the
younger boys worked as wheelers or pickers on the
bank-tops.&nbsp; The two girls helped their mother with the
household work.</p>
<p>Other workings of the coal were opened out in the
neighbourhood; and to one of these George was removed as fireman
on his own account.&nbsp; This was called the &ldquo;Mid Mill
Winnin,&rdquo; where he had for his mate a young man named
Coe.&nbsp; They worked together there for about two years, by
twelve-hour shifts, George firing the engine at the wage of a
shilling a day.&nbsp; He was now fifteen years old.&nbsp; His
ambition was as yet limited to attaining the standing of a full
workman, at a man&rsquo;s wages; and with that view he
endeavoured to attain such a knowledge of his engine as would
eventually lead to his employment as an engineman, with its
accompanying advantage of higher pay.&nbsp; He was a steady,
sober, hard-working young man, but nothing more in the estimation
of his fellow-workmen.</p>
<p>One of his favourite pastimes in by-hours was trying feats of
strength with his companions.&nbsp; Although in frame he was not
particularly robust, yet he was big and bony, and considered very
strong for his age.&nbsp; At throwing the hammer George had no
compeer.&nbsp; At lifting heavy weights off the ground from
between his feet, by means of a bar of iron passed through
them&mdash;placing the bar against his knees as a fulcrum, and
then straightening his spine and lifting them sheer up&mdash;he
was also very successful.&nbsp; On one occasion he lifted as much
as sixty stones weight&mdash;a striking indication of his
strength of bone and muscle.</p>
<p>When the pit at Mid Mill was closed, George and his companion
Coe were sent to work another pumping-engine erected near
Throckley Bridge, where they continued for some months.&nbsp; It
was while working at this place that his wages were raised to
12s. a week&mdash;an event to him of great importance.&nbsp; On
coming out of the foreman&rsquo;s office that Saturday evening on
which he received the advance, he announced the fact to his
fellow-workmen, adding triumphantly &ldquo;I am now a made man
for life!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>The pit opened at Newburn, at which old Robert
Stephenson worked, proving a failure, it was closed; and a new
pit was sunk at Water-row, on a strip of land lying between the
Wylam waggon-way and the river Tyne, about half a mile west of
Newburn Church.&nbsp; A pumping engine was erected there by
Robert Hawthorn, the Duke&rsquo;s engineer; and old Stephenson
went to work it as fireman, his son George acting as the
engineman or plugman.&nbsp; At that time he was about seventeen
years old&mdash;a very youthful age at which to fill so
responsible a post.&nbsp; He had thus already got ahead of his
father in his station as a workman; for the plugman holds a
higher grade than the fireman, requiring more practical knowledge
and skill, and usually receiving higher wages.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s duty as plugman was to watch the engine, to see
that it kept well in work, and that the pumps were efficient in
drawing the water.&nbsp; When the water-level in the pit was
lowered, and the suction became incomplete through the exposure
of the suction-holes, it was then his duty to proceed to the
bottom of the shaft and plug the tube so that the pump should
draw: hence the designation of &ldquo;plugman.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a
stoppage in the engine took place through any defect which he was
incapable of remedying, it was for him to call in the aid of the
chief engineer to set it to rights.</p>
<p>But from the time when George Stephenson was appointed
fireman, and more particularly afterwards as engineman, he
applied himself so assiduously and so successfully to the study
of the engine and its gearing&mdash;taking the machine to pieces
in his leisure hours for the purpose of cleaning and
understanding its various parts&mdash;that he soon acquired a
thorough practical knowledge of its construction and mode of
working, and very rarely needed to call the engineer of the
colliery to his aid.&nbsp; His engine became a sort of pet with
him, and he was never wearied of watching and inspecting it with
admiration.</p>
<p>Though eighteen years old, like many of his fellow-<!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>workmen, Stephenson had not yet learnt to read.&nbsp;
All that he could do was to get some one to read for him by his
engine fire, out of any book or stray newspaper which found its
way into the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Buonaparte was then overrunning
Italy, and astounding Europe by his brilliant succession of
victories; and there was no more eager auditor of his exploits,
as read from the newspaper accounts, than the young engineman at
the Water-row Pit.</p>
<p>There were also numerous stray bits of information and
intelligence contained in these papers, which excited
Stephenson&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; One of these related to the
Egyptian method of hatching birds&rsquo; eggs by means of
artificial heat.&nbsp; Curious about everything relating to
birds, he determined to test it by experiment.&nbsp; It was
spring time, and he forthwith went a birdnesting in the adjoining
woods and hedges.&nbsp; He gathered a collection of eggs of
various sorts, set them in flour in a warm place in the
engine-house, covering the whole with wool, and then waited the
issue.&nbsp; The heat was kept as steady as possible, and the
eggs were carefully turned every twelve hours, but though they
chipped, and some of them exhibited well-grown chicks, they never
hatched.&nbsp; The experiment failed, but the incident shows that
the inquiring mind of the youth was fairly at work.</p>
<p>Modelling of engines in clay continued to be another of his
favourite occupations.&nbsp; He made models of engines which he
had seen, and of others which were described to him.&nbsp; These
attempts were an improvement upon his first trials at Dewley Burn
bog, when occupied there as a herd-boy.&nbsp; He was, however,
anxious to know something of the wonderful engines of Boulton and
Watt, and was told that they were to be found fully described in
books, which he must search for information as to their
construction, action and uses.&nbsp; But, alas! Stephenson could
not read; he had not yet learnt even his letters.</p>
<p>Thus he shortly found, when gazing wistfully in the direction
of knowledge, that to advance further as a skilled <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>workman, he must master this wonderful art of
reading&mdash;the key to so many other arts.&nbsp; Only thus
could he gain an access to books, the depositories of the wisdom
and experience of the past.&nbsp; Although a grown man, and doing
the work of a man, he was not ashamed to confess his ignorance,
and go to school, big as he was, to learn his letters.&nbsp;
Perhaps, too, he foresaw that, in laying out a little of his
spare earnings for this purpose, he was investing money
judiciously, and that, in every hour he spent at school, he was
really working for better wages.</p>
<p>His first schoolmaster was Robin Cowens, a poor teacher in the
village of Walbottle.&nbsp; He kept a night-school, which was
attended by a few of the colliers and labourers&rsquo; sons in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; George took lessons in spelling and
reading three nights in the week.&nbsp; Robin Cowen&rsquo;s
teaching cost threepence a week; and though it was not very good,
yet George, being hungry for knowledge and eager to acquire it,
soon learnt to read.&nbsp; He also practised
&ldquo;pothooks,&rdquo; and at the age of nineteen he was proud
to be able to write his own name.</p>
<p>A Scotch dominie, named Andrew Robertson, set up a
night-school in the village of Newburn, in the winter of
1799.&nbsp; It was more convenient for George to attend this
school, as it was nearer to his work, and only a few
minutes&rsquo; walk from Jolly&rsquo;s Close.&nbsp; Besides,
Andrew had the reputation of being a skilled arithmetician; and
this branch of knowledge Stephenson was very desirous of
acquiring.&nbsp; He accordingly began taking lessons from him,
paying fourpence a week.&nbsp; Robert Gray, the junior fireman at
the Water-row Pit, began arithmetic at the same time; and Gray
afterwards told the author that George learnt
&ldquo;figuring&rdquo; so much faster than he did, that he could
not make out how it was&mdash;&ldquo;he took to figures so
wonderful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the two started together from
the same point, at the end of the winter George had mastered
&ldquo;reduction,&rdquo; while Robert Gray was still struggling
with the difficulties of simple division.&nbsp; But
George&rsquo;s secret was his <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>perseverance.&nbsp; He worked out the sums in his
bye-hours, improving every minute of his spare time by the
engine-fire, and studying there the arithmetical problems set for
him upon his slate by the master.&nbsp; In the evenings he took
to Robertson the sums which he had &ldquo;worked,&rdquo; and new
ones were &ldquo;set&rdquo; for him to study out the following
day.&nbsp; Thus his progress was rapid, and, with a willing heart
and mind, he soon became well advanced in arithmetic.&nbsp;
Indeed, Andrew Robertson became very proud of his scholar; and
shortly after, when the Water-row Pit was closed, and George
removed to Black Callerton to work there, the poor schoolmaster,
not having a very extensive connexion in Newburn, went with his
pupils, and set up his night-school at Black Callerton, where he
continued his lessons.</p>
<p>George still found time to attend to his favourite animals
while working at the Water-row Pit.&nbsp; Like his father, he
used to tempt the robin-redbreasts to hop and fly about him at
the engine-fire, by the bait of bread-crumbs saved from his
dinner.&nbsp; But his chief favourite was his dog&mdash;so
sagacious that he almost daily carried George&rsquo;s dinner to
him at the pit.&nbsp; The tin containing the meal was suspended
from the dog&rsquo;s neck, and, thus laden, he proceeded
faithfully from Jolly&rsquo;s Close to Water-row Pit, quite
through the village of Newburn.&nbsp; He turned neither to left
nor right, nor heeded the barking of curs at his heels.&nbsp; But
his course was not unattended with perils.&nbsp; One day the big
strange dog of a passing butcher espying the engineman&rsquo;s
messenger with the tin can about his neck, ran after and fell
upon him.&nbsp; There was a terrible tussle and worrying, which
lasted for a brief while, and, shortly after, the dog&rsquo;s
master, anxious for his dinner, saw his faithful servant
approaching, bleeding but triumphant.&nbsp; The tin can was still
round his neck, but the dinner had been spilt in the
struggle.&nbsp; Though George went without his dinner that day,
he was prouder of his dog than ever when the circumstances of the
combat were related to him by the villagers who had seen it.</p>
<p>It was while working at the Water-row Pit that <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Stephenson learnt the art of brakeing an engine.&nbsp;
This being one of the higher departments of colliery labour, and
among the best paid, George was very anxious to learn it.&nbsp; A
small winding-engine having been put up for the purpose of
drawing the coals from the pit, Bill Coe, his friend and
fellow-workman, was appointed the brakesman.&nbsp; He frequently
allowed George to try his hand at the machine, and instructed him
how to proceed.&nbsp; Coe was, however, opposed in this by
several of the other workmen&mdash;one of whom, a banksman named
William Locke, <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> went so far as to stop the working of
the pit because Stephenson had been called in to the brake.&nbsp;
But one day as Mr. Charles Nixon, the manager of the pit, was
observed approaching, Coe adopted an expedient which put a stop
to the opposition.&nbsp; He called upon Stephenson to &ldquo;come
into the brake-house, and take hold of the machine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Locke, as usual, sat down, and the working of the pit was
stopped.&nbsp; When requested by the manager to give an
explanation, he said that &ldquo;young Stephenson couldn&rsquo;t
brake, and, what was more, never would learn, he was so
clumsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Nixon, however, ordered Locke to go on
with the work, which he did; and Stephenson, after some further
practice, acquired the art of brakeing.</p>
<p>After working at the Water-row Pit and at other engines near
Newburn for about three years, George and Coe went to Black
Callerton early in 1801.&nbsp; Though only twenty years of age,
his employers thought so well of him that they appointed him to
the responsible office of brakesman at the Dolly Pit.&nbsp; For
convenience&rsquo; sake, he took lodgings at a small
farmer&rsquo;s in the village, finding his own victuals, and
paying so much a week for lodging and attendance.&nbsp; In the
locality this was called &ldquo;picklin in his awn poke
neuk.&rdquo;&nbsp; It not unfrequently happens that the young
workman about the collieries, when selecting a lodging, contrives
to pitch his tent where the daughter of the house ultimately <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>becomes his wife.&nbsp; This is often the real
attraction that draws the youth from home, though a very
different one may be pretended.</p>
<p>George Stephenson&rsquo;s duties as brakesman may be briefly
described.&nbsp; The work was somewhat monotonous, and consisted
in superintending the working of the engine and machinery by
means of which the coals were drawn out of the pit.&nbsp;
Brakesman are almost invariably selected from those who have had
considerable experience as engine-firemen, and borne a good
character for steadiness, punctuality, watchfulness, and
&ldquo;mother wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; In George Stephenson&rsquo;s day
the coals were drawn out of the pit in corves, or large baskets
made of hazel rods.&nbsp; The corves were placed together in a
cage, between which and the pit-ropes there was usually from
fifteen to twenty feet of chain.&nbsp; The approach of the corves
towards the pit mouth was signalled by a bell, brought into
action by a piece of mechanism worked from the shaft of the
engine.&nbsp; When the bell sounded, the brakesman checked the
speed, by taking hold of the hand-gear connected with the
steam-valves, which were so arranged that by their means he could
regulate the speed of the engine, and stop or set it in motion
when required.&nbsp; Connected with the fly-wheel was a powerful
wooden brake, acting by pressure against its rim, something like
the brake of a railway-carriage against its wheels.&nbsp; On
catching sight of the chain attached to the ascending corve-cage,
the brakesman, by pressing his foot upon a foot-step near him,
was enabled, with great precision, to stop the revolutions of the
wheel, and arrest the ascent of the corves at the pit mouth, when
they were forthwith landed on the &ldquo;settle
board.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the full corves being replaced by empty
ones, it was then the duty of the brakesman to reverse the
engine, and send the corves down the pit to be filled again.</p>
<p>The monotony of George Stephenson&rsquo;s occupation as a
brakesman was somewhat varied by the change which he made, in his
turn, from the day to the night shift.&nbsp; His duty, on the
latter occasions, consisted chiefly in sending <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>men and
materials into the mine, and in drawing other men and materials
out.&nbsp; Most of the workmen enter the pit during the night
shift, and leave it in the latter part of the day, whilst
coal-drawing is proceeding.&nbsp; The requirements of the work at
night are such, that the brakesman has a good deal of spare time
on his hands, which he is at liberty to employ in his own
way.&nbsp; From an early period, George was accustomed to employ
those vacant night hours in working the sums set for him by
Andrew Robertson upon his slate, practising writing in his
copy-book, and mending the shoes of his fellow-workmen.&nbsp; His
wages while working at the Dolly Pit amounted to from &pound;1
15s. to &pound;2 in the fortnight; but he gradually added to them
as he became more expert at shoe-mending, and afterwards at
shoe-making.</p>
<p>Probably he was stimulated to take in hand this extra work by
the attachment he had by this time formed for a young woman named
Fanny Henderson, who officiated as servant in the small
farmer&rsquo;s house in which he lodged.&nbsp; We have been
informed that the personal attractions of Fanny, though these
were considerable, were the least of her charms.&nbsp; Mr.
William Fairbairn, who afterwards saw her in her home at
Willington Quay, describes her as a very comely woman.&nbsp; But
her temper was one of the sweetest; and those who knew her were
accustomed to speak of the charming modesty of her demeanour, her
kindness of disposition, and withal her sound good sense.</p>
<p>Amongst his various mendings of old shoes at Callerton.&nbsp;
George was on one occasion favoured with the shoes of his
sweetheart to sole.&nbsp; One can imagine the pleasure with which
he would linger over such a piece of work, and the pride with
which he would execute it.&nbsp; A friend of his, still living,
relates that, after he had finished the shoes, he carried them
about with him in his pocket on the Sunday afternoon, and that
from time to time he would pull them out and hold them up,
exclaiming, &ldquo;what a capital job he had made of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Out of his earnings by shoe-mending at Callerton, George
contrived to save his first guinea.&nbsp; The first guinea saved
by a working man is no trivial thing.&nbsp; If, as in
Stephenson&rsquo;s case, it has been the result of prudent
self-denial, of extra labour at bye-hours, and of the honest
resolution to save and economise for worthy purposes, the first
guinea saved is an earnest of better things.&nbsp; When
Stephenson had saved this guinea he was not a little elated at
the achievement, and expressed the opinion to a friend, who many
years after reminded him of it, that he was &ldquo;now a rich
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long after he began to work at Black Callerton as
brakesman, he had a quarrel with a pitman named Ned Nelson, a
roistering bully, who was the terror of the village.&nbsp; Nelson
was a great fighter; and it was therefore considered dangerous to
quarrel with him.&nbsp; Stephenson was so unfortunate as not to
be able to please this pitman by the way in which he drew him out
of the pit; and Nelson swore at him grossly because of the
alleged clumsiness of his brakeing.&nbsp; George defended
himself, and appealed to the testimony of the other
workmen.&nbsp; But Nelson had not been accustomed to
George&rsquo;s style of self-assertion; and, after a great deal
of abuse, he threatened to kick the brakesman, who defied him to
do so.&nbsp; Nelson ended by challenging Stephenson to a pitched
battle; and the latter accepted the challenge, when a day was
fixed on which the fight was to come off.</p>
<p>Great was the excitement at Black Callerton when it was known
that George Stephenson had accepted Nelson&rsquo;s
challenge.&nbsp; Everybody said he would be killed.&nbsp; The
villagers, the young men, and especially the boys of the place,
with whom George was a great favourite, all wished that he might
beat Nelson, but they scarcely dared to say so.&nbsp; They came
about him while he was at work in the engine-house to inquire if
it was really true that he was &ldquo;goin to fight
Nelson?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay; never fear for me; I&rsquo;ll
fight him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And fight him he did.&nbsp; For some days
previous to <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the appointed day of battle, Nelson
went entirely off work for the purpose of keeping himself fresh
and strong, whereas Stephenson went on doing his daily work as
usual, and appeared not in the least disconcerted by the prospect
of the affair.&nbsp; So, on the evening appointed, after George
had done his day&rsquo;s labour, he went into the Dolly Pit
Field, where his already exulting rival was ready to meet
him.&nbsp; George stripped, and &ldquo;went in&rdquo; like a
practised pugilist&mdash;though it was his first and last
fight.&nbsp; After a few rounds, George&rsquo;s wiry muscles and
practised strength enabled him severely to punish his adversary,
and to secure an easy victory.</p>
<p>This circumstance is related in illustration of
Stephenson&rsquo;s personal pluck and courage; and it was
thoroughly characteristic of the man.&nbsp; He was no pugilist,
and the very reverse of quarrelsome.&nbsp; But he would not be
put down by the bully of the colliery, and he fought him.&nbsp;
There his pugilism ended; they afterwards shook hands, and
continued good friends.&nbsp; In after life, Stephenson&rsquo;s
mettle was often as hardly tried, though in a different way; and
he did not fail to exhibit the same resolute courage in
contending with the bullies of the railway world, as he showed in
his encounter with Ned Nelson, the fighting pitman of
Callerton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smcap">Engineman at Willington Quay and
Killingworth</span>.</h2>
<p>George Stephenson had now acquired the character of an expert
workman.&nbsp; He was diligent and observant while at work, and
sober and studious when the day&rsquo;s work was over.&nbsp; His
friend Coe described him to the author as &ldquo;a standing
example of manly character.&rdquo;&nbsp; On pay-Saturday
afternoons, when the pitmen held their fortnightly holiday,
occupying themselves chiefly in cock-fighting and dog-fighting in
the adjoining fields, followed by adjournments <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>to the
&ldquo;yel-house,&rdquo; George was accustomed to take his engine
to pieces, for the purpose of obtaining &ldquo;insight,&rdquo;
and he cleaned all the parts and put the machine in thorough
working order before leaving it.</p>
<p>In the evenings he improved himself in the arts of reading and
writing, and occasionally took a turn at modelling.&nbsp; It was
at Callerton, his son Robert informed us, that he began to try
his hand at original invention; and for some time he applied his
attention to a machine of the nature of an engine-brake, which
reversed itself by its own action.&nbsp; But nothing came of the
contrivance, and it was eventually thrown aside as useless.&nbsp;
Yet not altogether so; for even the highest skill must undergo
the inevitable discipline of experiment, and submit to the
wholesome correction of occasional failure.</p>
<p>After working at Callerton for about two years, he received an
offer to take charge of the engine on Willington Ballast Hill at
an advanced wage.&nbsp; He determined to accept it, and at the
same time to marry Fanny Henderson, and begin housekeeping on his
own account.&nbsp; Though he was only twenty-one years old, he
had contrived, by thrift, steadiness, and industry, to save as
much money as enabled him to take a cottage-dwelling at
Willington Quay, and furnish it in a humble but comfortable style
for the reception of his bride.</p>
<p>Willington Quay lies on the north bank of the Tyne, about six
miles below Newcastle.&nbsp; It consists of a line of houses
straggling along the river-side; and high behind it towers up the
huge mound of ballast emptied out of the ships which resort to
the quay for their cargoes of coal for the London market.&nbsp;
The ballast is thrown out of the ships&rsquo; holds into waggons
laid alongside, which are run up to the summit of the Ballast
Hill, and emptied out there.&nbsp; At the foot of the great mound
of shot rubbish was the fixed engine of which George Stephenson
acted as brakesman.</p>
<p>The cottage in which he took up his abode was a small
two-storied dwelling, standing a little back from the quay <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>with a bit of garden ground in front. <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; The Stephenson family occupied
the upper room in the west end of the cottage.&nbsp; Close behind
rose the Ballast Hill.</p>
<p>When the cottage dwelling had been made snug, and was ready
for occupation, the marriage took place.&nbsp; It was celebrated
in Newburn Church, on the 28th of November, 1802.&nbsp; After the
ceremony, George, with his newly-wedded wife, proceeded to the
house of his father at Jolly&rsquo;s Close.&nbsp; The old man was
now becoming infirm, and, though he still worked as an
engine-fireman, contrived with difficulty &ldquo;to keep his head
above water.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the visit had been paid, the
bridal party set out for their new home at Willington Quay,
whither they went in a manner quite common before travelling by
railway came into use.&nbsp; Two farm horses, borrowed from a
neighbouring farmer, were each provided with a saddle and
pillion, and George having mounted one, his wife seated herself
behind him, holding on by his waist.&nbsp; The bridesman and
bridesmaid in like manner mounted the other horse; and in this
wise the wedding party rode across the country, passing through
the old streets of Newcastle, and then by Wallsend to Willington
Quay&mdash;a ride of about fifteen miles.</p>
<p>George Stephenson&rsquo;s daily life at Willington was that of
a steady workman.&nbsp; By the manner, however, in which he
continued to improve his spare hours in the evening, he was
silently and surely paving the way for being something more than
a manual labourer.&nbsp; He set himself to study diligently the
principles of mechanics, and to master the laws by which his
engine worked.&nbsp; For a workman, he was even at that time more
than ordinarily speculative&mdash;often taking up strange
theories, and trying to sift out the truth that was in
them.&nbsp; While sitting by his wife&rsquo;s side in his
cottage-dwelling in the winter evenings, he was <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>usually
occupied in studying mechanical subjects, or in modelling
experimental machines.&nbsp; Amongst his various speculations
while at Willington, he tried to discover a means of Perpetual
Motion.&nbsp; Although he failed, as so many others had done
before him, the very efforts he made tended to whet his inventive
faculties, and to call forth his dormant powers.&nbsp; He went so
far as to construct the model of a machine for the purpose.&nbsp;
It consisted of a wooden wheel, the periphery of which was
furnished with glass tubes filled with quicksilver; as the wheel
rotated, the quicksilver poured itself down into the lower tubes,
and thus a sort of self-acting motion was kept up in the
apparatus, which, however, did not prove to be perpetual.&nbsp;
Where he had first obtained the idea of this
machine&mdash;whether from conversation or reading, is not known;
but his son Robert was of opinion that he had heard of the
apparatus of this kind described in the &ldquo;History of
Inventions.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he had then no access to books, and
indeed could barely read with ease, it is probable that he had
been told of the contrivance, and set about testing its value
according to his own methods.</p>
<p>Much of his spare time continued to be occupied by labour more
immediately profitable, regarded in a pecuniary point of
view.&nbsp; In the evenings, after his day&rsquo;s labour at his
engine, he would occasionally employ himself for an hour or two
in casting ballast out of the collier ships, by which means he
was enabled to earn a few extra shillings weekly.&nbsp; Mr.
William Fairbairn of Manchester has informed us that while
Stephenson was employed at Willington, he himself was working in
the neighbourhood as an engine apprentice at the Percy Main
Colliery.&nbsp; He was very fond of George, who was a fine,
hearty fellow, besides being a capital workman.&nbsp; In the
summer evenings young Fairbairn was accustomed to go down to the
Quay to see his friend, and on such occasions he would frequently
take charge of George&rsquo;s engine while he took a turn at
heaving ballast out of the ships&rsquo; holds.&nbsp; It is
pleasant to think of <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the future President of the British
Association thus helping the future Railway Engineer to earn a
few extra shillings by overwork in the evenings, at a time when
both occupied the rank of humble working men in an obscure
northern village.</p>
<p>Mr. Fairbairn was also a frequent visitor at George&rsquo;s
cottage on the Quay, where, though there was no luxury, there was
comfort, cleanliness, and a pervading spirit of industry.&nbsp;
Even at home George was never for a moment idle.&nbsp; When there
was no ballast to heave out at the Quay he took in shoes to mend;
and from mending he proceeded to making them, as well as
shoe-lasts, in which he was admitted to be very expert.</p>
<p>But an accident occurred in Stephenson&rsquo;s household about
this time, which had the effect of directing his industry into a
new and still more profitable channel.&nbsp; The cottage chimney
took fire one day in his absence, when the alarmed neighbours,
rushing in, threw quantities of water upon the flames; and some,
in their zeal, even mounted the ridge of the house, and poured
buckets of water down the chimney.&nbsp; The fire was soon put
out, but the house was thoroughly soaked.&nbsp; When George came
home he found everything in disorder, and his new furniture
covered with soot.&nbsp; The eight-day clock, which hung against
the wall&mdash;one of the most highly-prized articles in the
house&mdash;was much damaged by the steam with which the room had
been filled; and its wheels were so clogged by the dust and soot
that it was brought to a complete standstill.&nbsp; George was
always ready to turn his hand to anything, and his ingenuity,
never at fault, immediately set to work to repair the unfortunate
clock.&nbsp; He was advised to send it to the clockmaker, but
that would cost money; and he declared that he would repair it
himself&mdash;at least he would try.&nbsp; The clock was
accordingly taken to pieces and cleaned; the tools which he had
been accumulating for the purpose of constructing his Perpetual
Motion machine, enabled him to do this readily; and he succeeded
so well that, shortly after, the neighbours sent <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>him
their clocks to clean, and he soon became one of the most famous
clock-doctors in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It was while living at Willington Quay that George
Stephenson&rsquo;s only son was born, on the 16th of October,
1803.&nbsp; The child was a great favourite with his father, and
added much to the happiness of his evening hours.&nbsp;
George&rsquo;s &ldquo;philoprogenitiveness,&rdquo; as
phrenologists call it, had been exercised hitherto upon birds,
dogs, rabbits, and even the poor old gin-horses which he had
driven at the Callerton Pit; but in his boy he now found a much
more genial object for the exercise of his affection.</p>
<p>The christening took place in the school-house at Wallsend,
the old parish church being at the time in so dilapidated a
condition from the &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; or subsidence of the
ground, consequent upon the excavation of the coal, that it was
considered dangerous to enter it.&nbsp; On this occasion, Robert
Gray and Anne Henderson, who had officiated as bridesman and
bridesmaid at the wedding, came over again to Willington, and
stood godfather and godmother to little Robert,&mdash;so named
after his grandfather.</p>
<p>After working for several years more as a brakesman at the
Willington machine, George Stephenson was induced to leave his
situation there for a similar one at the West Moor Colliery,
Killingworth.&nbsp; It was not without considerable persuasion
that he was induced to leave the Quay, as he knew that he should
thereby give up the chance of earning extra money by casting
ballast from the keels.&nbsp; At last, however, he consented, in
the hope of making up the loss in some other way.</p>
<p>The village of Killingworth lies about seven miles north of
Newcastle, and is one of the best-known collieries in that
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The workings of the coal are of vast extent,
and give employment to a large number of work-people.&nbsp; To
this place Stephenson first came as a brakesman about the
beginning of 1805.&nbsp; He had not been long in his new place,
ere his wife died (in 1806), shortly after giving birth to a
daughter, who survived the mother only a <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>few
months.&nbsp; George deeply felt the loss of his wife, for they
had been very happy together.&nbsp; Their lot had been sweetened
by daily successful toil.&nbsp; The husband was sober and
hard-working, and his wife made his hearth so bright and his home
so snug, that no attraction could draw him from her side in the
evening hours.&nbsp; But this domestic happiness was all to pass
away; and George felt as one that had thenceforth to tread the
journey of life alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Shortly after this event, while his grief was still fresh, he
received an invitation from some gentlemen concerned in large
spinning works near Montrose in Scotland, to proceed thither and
superintend the working of one of Boulton and Watt&rsquo;s
engines.&nbsp; He accepted the offer, and made arrangements to
leave Killingworth for a time.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Having left his little boy in good keeping, he set out
upon his long journey to Scotland on foot, with his kit upon his
back.&nbsp; While working at Montrose he gave a striking proof of
that practical ability in contrivance for which he was afterwards
so distinguished.&nbsp; It appears that the water required for
the purposes of his engine, as well as for the use of the works,
was pumped from a considerable depth, being supplied from the
adjacent extensive sand strata.&nbsp; The pumps frequently got
choked by the sand drawn in at the bottom of the well through the
snore-holes, or apertures through which the water to be raised is
admitted.&nbsp; The barrels soon became worn, and the bucket and
clack leathers destroyed, so that it became necessary to devise a
remedy; and with this object the engineman proceeded to adopt the
following simple but original expedient.&nbsp; He had a wooden
box or boot made, twelve feet high, which he placed in the sump
or well, and into this he inserted the lower end of the
pump.&nbsp; The result was, that the water flowed clear from the
outer part of the well over into the boot, and being drawn up
without any admixture of sand, the difficulty was thus conquered.
<a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>Being paid good wages, Stephenson contrived, during the year
he worked at Montrose, to save a sum of &pound;28, which he took
back with him to Killingworth.&nbsp; Longing to get back to his
kindred, his heart yearning for the son whom he had left behind,
our engineman took leave of his employers, and trudged back to
Northumberland on foot as he had gone.&nbsp; While on his journey
southward he arrived late one evening, footsore and wearied, at
the door of a small farmer&rsquo;s cottage, at which he knocked,
and requested shelter for the night.&nbsp; It was refused, and
then he entreated <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that, being tired, and unable to
proceed further, the farmer would permit him to lie down in the
outhouse, for that a little clean straw would serve him.&nbsp;
The farmer&rsquo;s wife appeared at the door, looked at the
traveller, then retiring with her husband, the two confabulated a
little apart, and finally they invited Stephenson into the
cottage.&nbsp; Always full of conversation and anecdote, he soon
made himself at home in the farmer&rsquo;s family, and spent with
them a few pleasant hours.&nbsp; He was hospitably entertained
for the night, and when he left the cottage in the morning, he
pressed them to make some charge for his lodging, but they
refused to accept any recompense.&nbsp; They only asked him to
remember them kindly, and if he ever came that way, to be sure
and call again.&nbsp; Many years after, when Stephenson had
become a thriving man, he did not forget the humble pair who had
succoured and entertained him on his way; he sought their cottage
again, when age had silvered their hair; and when he left the
aged couple, they may have been reminded of the old saying that
we may sometimes &ldquo;entertain angels unawares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching home, Stephenson found that his father had met with a
serious accident at the Blucher Pit, which had reduced him to
great distress and poverty.&nbsp; While engaged in the inside of
an engine, making some repairs, a fellow-workman accidentally let
in the steam upon him.&nbsp; The blast struck him full in the
face; he was terribly scorched, and his eyesight was
irretrievably lost.&nbsp; The helpless and infirm man had
struggled for a time with poverty; his sons who were at home,
poor as himself, were little able to help him, while George was
at a distance in Scotland.&nbsp; On his return, however, with his
savings in his pocket, his first step was to pay off his
father&rsquo;s debts, amounting to about &pound;15; and shortly
after he removed the aged pair from Jolly&rsquo;s Close to a
comfortable cottage adjoining the tramroad near the West Moor at
Killingworth, where the old man lived for many years, supported
entirely by his son.</p>
<p>Stephenson was again taken on as a brakesman at the <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>West
Moor Pit.&nbsp; He does not seem to have been very hopeful as to
his prospects in life about this time (1807&ndash;8).&nbsp;
Indeed the condition of the working class generally was very
discouraging.&nbsp; England was engaged in a great war, which
pressed upon the industry, and severely tried the resources, of
the country.&nbsp; There was a constant demand for men to fill
the army.&nbsp; The working people were also liable to be pressed
for the navy, or drawn for the militia; and though they could not
fail to be discontented under such circumstances, they scarcely
dared even to mutter their discontent to their neighbours.</p>
<p>Stephenson was drawn for the militia: he must therefore either
quit his work and go a-soldiering, or find a substitute.&nbsp; He
adopted the latter course, and borrowed &pound;6, which, with the
remainder of his savings, enabled him to provide a militiaman to
serve in his stead.&nbsp; Thus the whole of his hard-won earnings
were swept away at a stroke.&nbsp; He was almost in despair, and
contemplated the idea of leaving the country, and emigrating to
the United States.&nbsp; Although a voyage thither was then a
much more formidable thing for a working man to accomplish than a
voyage to Australia is now, he seriously entertained the project,
and had all but made up his mind to go.&nbsp; His sister Ann,
with her husband, emigrated about that time, but George could not
raise the requisite money, and they departed without him.&nbsp;
After all, it went sore against his heart to leave his home and
his kindred, the scenes of his youth and the friends of his
boyhood; and he struggled long with the idea, brooding over it in
sorrow.&nbsp; Speaking afterwards to a friend of his thoughts at
the time, he said: &ldquo;You know the road from my house at the
West Moor to Killingworth.&nbsp; I remember once when I went
along that road I wept bitterly, for I knew not where my lot in
life would be cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1808, Stephenson, with two other brakesmen, took a small
contract under the colliery lessees for brakeing the engines at
the West Moor Pit.&nbsp; The brakesmen found the <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>oil
and tallow; they divided the work amongst them, and were paid so
much per score for their labour.&nbsp; It was the interest of the
brakesmen to economise the working as much as possible, and
George no sooner entered upon the contract than he proceeded to
devise ways and means of making it &ldquo;pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
observed that the ropes which, at other pits in the
neighbourhood, lasted about three months, at the West Moor Pit
became worn out in about a month.&nbsp; He immediately set about
ascertaining the cause of the defect; and finding it to be
occasioned by excessive friction, he proceeded, with the sanction
of the head engine-wright and the colliery owners, to shift the
pulley-wheels and re-arrange the gearing, which had the effect of
greatly diminishing the tear and wear, besides allowing the work
of the colliery to proceed without interruption.</p>
<p>About the same time he attempted an improvement in the
winding-engine which he worked, by placing a valve between the
air-pump and condenser.&nbsp; This expedient, although it led to
no practical result, showed that his mind was actively engaged in
studying new mechanical adaptations.&nbsp; It continued to be his
regular habit, on Saturdays, to take his engine to pieces, for
the purpose, at the same time, of familiarising himself with its
action, and of placing it in a state of thorough working
order.&nbsp; By mastering its details, he was enabled, as
opportunity occurred, to turn to practical account the knowledge
he thus diligently and patiently acquired.</p>
<p>Such an opportunity was not long in presenting itself.&nbsp;
In the year 1810, a new pit was sunk by the &ldquo;Grand
Allies&rdquo; (the lessees of the mines) at the village of
Killingworth, now known as the Killingworth High Pit.&nbsp; An
atmospheric or Newcomen engine, made by Smeaton, was fixed there
for the purpose of pumping out the water from the shaft; but
somehow it failed to clear the pit.&nbsp; As one of the workmen
has since described the circumstance&mdash;&ldquo;She
couldn&rsquo;t keep her jack-head in water: all the enginemen in
the neighbourhood were tried, as well as Crowther <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of
the Ouseburn, but they were clean bet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The engine
had been fruitlessly pumping for nearly twelve months, and began
to be spoken of as a total failure.&nbsp; Stephenson had gone to
look at it when in course of erection, and then observed to the
over-man that he thought it was defective; he also gave it as his
opinion that, if there were much water in the mine, the engine
would never keep it under.&nbsp; Of course, as he was only a
brakesman, his opinion was considered to be worth very little on
such a point.&nbsp; He continued, however, to make frequent
visits to the engine, to see &ldquo;how she was getting
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the bank-head where he worked his brake he
could see the chimney smoking at the High Pit; and as the men
were passing to and from their work, he would call out and
inquire &ldquo;if they had gotten to the bottom yet?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the reply was always to the same effect&mdash;the pumping
made no progress, and the workmen were still &ldquo;drowned
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon he went over to the High Pit to examine
the engine more carefully than he had yet done.&nbsp; He had been
turning the subject over thoughtfully in his mind; and seemed to
have satisfied himself as to the cause of the failure.&nbsp; Kit
Heppel, one of the sinkers, asked him, &ldquo;Weel, George, what
do you mak&rsquo; o&rsquo; her?&nbsp; Do you think you could do
anything to improve her?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said George, &ldquo;I could
alter her, man, and make her draw: in a week&rsquo;s time I could
send you to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith Heppel reported this conversation to Ralph Dodds,
the head viewer, who, being now quite in despair, and hopeless of
succeeding with the engine, determined to give George&rsquo;s
skill a trial.&nbsp; At the worst he could only fail, as the rest
had done.&nbsp; In the evening, Dodds went in search of
Stephenson, and met him on the road, dressed in his
Sunday&rsquo;s suit, on the way to &ldquo;the preaching&rdquo; in
the Methodist Chapel, which he attended.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
George,&rdquo; said Dodds, &ldquo;they tell me that you think you
can put the engine at the High Pit to rights.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll
give you a fair <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>trial, and you must set to work
immediately.&nbsp; We are clean drowned out, and cannot get a
stop further.&nbsp; The engineers hereabouts are all bet; and if
you really succeed in accomplishing what they cannot do, you may
depend upon it I will make you a man for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephenson began his operations early next morning.&nbsp; The
only condition that he made, before setting to work, was that he
should select his own workmen.&nbsp; There was, as he knew, a
good deal of jealousy amongst the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; men that
a colliery brakesman should pretend to know more about their
engine than they themselves did, and attempt to remedy defects
which the most skilled men of their craft, including the engineer
of the colliery, had failed to do.&nbsp; But George made the
condition a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
workmen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;must either be all Whigs or all
Tories.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no help for it, so Dodds ordered
the old hands to stand aside.&nbsp; The men grumbled, but gave
way; and then George and his party went in.</p>
<p>The engine was taken entirely to pieces.&nbsp; The cistern
containing the injection water was raised ten feet; the injection
cock, being too small, was enlarged to nearly double its former
size, and it was so arranged that it should be shut off quickly
at the beginning of the stroke.&nbsp; These and other alterations
were necessarily performed in a rough way, but, as the result
proved, on true principles.&nbsp; Stephenson also, finding that
the boiler would bear a greater pressure than five pounds to the
inch, determined to work it at a pressure of ten pounds, though
this was contrary to the directions of both Newcomen and
Smeaton.&nbsp; The necessary alterations were made in about three
days, and many persons came to see the engine start, including
the men who had put her up.&nbsp; The pit being nearly full of
water, she had little to do on starting, and, to use
George&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;came bounce into the
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dodds exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, she was better
as she was; now, she will knock the house down.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a short time, however, the engine got fairly to work, and
by ten o&rsquo;clock that night the water was <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>lower in the
pit than it had ever been before.&nbsp; It was kept pumping all
Thursday, and by the Friday afternoon the pit was cleared of
water, and the workmen were &ldquo;sent to the bottom,&rdquo; as
Stephenson had promised.&nbsp; Thus the alterations effected in
the pumping apparatus proved completely successful.</p>
<p>Dodds was particularly gratified with the manner in which the
job had been done, and he made Stephenson a present of ten
pounds, which, though very inadequate when compared with the
value of the work performed, was accepted with gratitude.&nbsp;
George was proud of the gift as the first marked recognition of
his skill as a workman; and he used afterwards to say that it was
the biggest sum of money he had up to that time earned in one
lump.&nbsp; Ralph Dodds, however, did more than this.&nbsp; He
released the brakesman from the handles of his engine at West
Moot, and appointed him engineman at the High Pit, at good wages,
during the time the pit was sinking,&mdash;the job lasting for
about a year; and he also kept him in mind for further
advancement.</p>
<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s skill as an engine-doctor soon became
noised abroad, and he was called upon to prescribe remedies for
all the old, wheezy, and ineffective pumping-machines in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In this capacity he soon left the
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; men far behind, though they in their turn
were very mach disposed to treat the Killingworth brakesman as no
better than a quack.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his practice was really
founded upon a close study of the principles of mechanics, and on
an intimate practical acquaintance with the details of the
pumping-engine.</p>
<p>Another of his smaller achievements in the same line is still
told by the people of the district.&nbsp; At the corner of the
road leading to Long Benton, there was a quarry from which a
peculiar and scarce kind of ochre was taken.&nbsp; In the course
of working it out, the water had collected in considerable
quantities; and there being no means of draining it off, it
accumulated to such an extent that the further working of <!--
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>the ochre was almost entirely stopped.&nbsp; Ordinary
pumps were tried, and failed; and then a windmill was tried, and
failed too.&nbsp; On this, George was asked what ought to be done
to clear the quarry of the water.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;he would
set up for them an engine little bigger than a kail-pot, that
would clear them out in a week.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he did so.&nbsp;
A little engine was speedily erected, by means of which the
quarry was pumped dry in the course of a few days.&nbsp; Thus his
skill as a pump-doctor soon became the marvel of the
district.</p>
<p>In elastic muscular vigour, Stephenson was now in his prime,
and he still continued to be zealous in measuring his strength
and agility with his fellow workmen.&nbsp; The competitive
element in his nature was always strong; and his success in these
feats of rivalry was certainly remarkable.&nbsp; Few, if any,
could lift such weights, throw the hammer and putt the stone so
far, or cover so great a space at a standing or running
leap.&nbsp; One day, between the engine hour and the rope-rolling
hour, Kit Heppel challenged him to leap from one high wall to
another, with a deep gap between.&nbsp; To Heppel&rsquo;s
surprise and dismay, George took the standing leap, and cleared
the eleven feet at a bound.&nbsp; Had his eye been less accurate,
or his limbs less agile and sure, the feat must have cost him his
life.</p>
<p>But so full of redundant muscular vigour was he, that leaping,
putting, or throwing the hammer were not enough for him.&nbsp; He
was also ambitious of riding on horseback, and, as he had not yet
been promoted to an office enabling him to keep a horse of his
own, he sometimes borrowed one of the gin-horses for a
ride.&nbsp; On one of these occasions, he brought the animal back
reeking; when Tommy Mitcheson, the bank horse-keeper, a
rough-spoken fellow, exclaimed to him: &ldquo;Set such fellows as
you on horseback, and you&rsquo;ll soon ride to the
De&rsquo;il.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Tommy Mitcheson lived to tell the
joke, and to confess that, after all, there had been a better
issue to George&rsquo;s horsemanship than that which he
predicted.</p>

having been killed by an accident, George Stephenson was, in
1812, appointed engine-wright of the colliery at the salary of
&pound;100 a year.&nbsp; He was also allowed the use of a
galloway to ride upon in his visits of inspection to the
collieries leased by the &ldquo;Grand Allies&rdquo; in that
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Grand Allies&rdquo; were a
company of gentlemen, consisting of Sir Thomas Liddell
(afterwards Lord Ravensworth), the Earl of Strathmore, and Mr.
Stuart Wortley (afterwards Lord Wharncliffe), the lessees of the
Killingworth collieries.&nbsp; Having been informed of the merits
of Stephenson, of his indefatigable industry, and the skill which
he had displayed in the repairs of the pumping-engines, they
readily acceded to Mr. Dodds&rsquo; recommendation that he should
be appointed the colliery engine-wright; and, as we shall
afterwards find, they continued to honour him by distinguished
marks of their approval.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Stephensons at
Killingworth</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Education and
Self-Education of Father and Son</span>.</h2>
<p>George Stephenson had now been diligently employed for several
years in the work of self-improvement, and he experienced the
usual results in increasing mental strength, capability, and
skill.&nbsp; Perhaps the secret of every man&rsquo;s best success
is to be found in the alacrity and industry with which he takes
advantage of the opportunities which present themselves for
well-doing.&nbsp; Our engineman was an eminent illustration of
the importance of cultivating this habit of life.&nbsp; Every
spare moment was laid under contribution by him, either for the
purpose of adding to his earnings, or to his knowledge.&nbsp; He
missed no opportunity of extending his observations, especially
in his own department of <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>work, ever
aiming at improvement, and trying to turn all that he did know to
useful practical account.</p>
<p>He continued his attempts to solve the mystery of Perpetual
Motion, and contrived several model machines with the object of
embodying his ideas in a practical working shape.&nbsp; He
afterwards used to lament the time he had lost in these futile
efforts, and said that if he had enjoyed the opportunity which
most young men now have, of learning from books what previous
experimenters had accomplished, he would have been spared much
labour and mortification.&nbsp; Not being acquainted with what
other mechanics had done, he groped his way in pursuit of some
idea originated by his own independent thinking and observation;
and, when he had brought it into some definite form, lo! he found
that his supposed invention had long been known and recorded in
scientific books.&nbsp; Often he thought he had hit upon
discoveries, which he subsequently found were but old and
exploded fallacies.&nbsp; Yet his very struggle to overcome the
difficulties which lay in his way, was of itself an education of
the best sort.&nbsp; By wrestling with them, he strengthened his
judgment and sharpened his skill, stimulating and cultivating his
inventiveness and mechanical ingenuity.&nbsp; Being very much in
earnest, he was compelled to consider the subject of his special
inquiry in all its relations; and thus he gradually acquired
practical ability even through his very efforts after the
impracticable.</p>
<p>Many of his evenings were now spent in the society of John
Wigham, whose father occupied the Glebe Farm at Benton, close at
hand.&nbsp; John was a fair penman and a sound arithmetician, and
Stephenson sought his society chiefly for the purpose of
improving himself in writing and &ldquo;figures.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Under Andrew Robertson, he had never quite mastered the Rule of
Three, and it was only when Wigham took him in hand that he made
much progress in the higher branches of arithmetic.&nbsp; He
generally took his slate with him to the Wighams&rsquo; cottage,
when he had his sums set, that he might work them out while
tending his engine on <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the following day.&nbsp; When too
busy to be able to call upon Wigham, he sent the slate to have
the former sums corrected and new ones set.&nbsp; Sometimes also,
at leisure moments, he was enabled to do a little
&ldquo;figuring&rdquo; with chalk upon the sides of the
coal-waggons.&nbsp; So much patient perseverance could not but
eventually succeed; and by dint of practice and study, Stephenson
was enabled to master successively the various rules of
arithmetic.</p>
<p>John Wigham was of great use to his pupil in many ways.&nbsp;
He was a good talker, fond of argument, an extensive reader as
country reading went in those days, and a very suggestive
thinker.&nbsp; Though his store of information might be
comparatively small when measured with that of more
highly-cultivated minds, much of it was entirely new to
Stephenson, who regarded him as a very clever and ingenious
person.&nbsp; Wigham taught him to draw plans and sections;
though in this branch Stephenson proved so apt that he soon
surpassed his master.&nbsp; A volume of &lsquo;Ferguson&rsquo;s
Lectures on Mechanics,&rsquo; which fell into their hands, was a
great treasure to both the students.&nbsp; One who remembers
their evening occupations says he used to wonder what they meant
by weighing the air and water in so odd a way.&nbsp; They were
trying the specific gravities of objects; and the devices which
they employed, the mechanical shifts to which they were put, were
often of the rudest kind.&nbsp; In these evening entertainments,
the mechanical contrivances were supplied by Stephenson, whilst
Wigham found the scientific rationale.&nbsp; The opportunity thus
afforded to the former of cultivating his mind by contact with
one wiser than himself proved of great value, and in after-life
Stephenson gratefully remembered the assistance which, when a
humble workman, he had derived from John Wigham, the
farmer&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>His leisure moments thus carefully improved, it will be
inferred that Stephenson continued a sober man.&nbsp; Though his
notions were never extreme on this point, he was systematically
temperate.&nbsp; It appears that on the invitation <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of
his master, he had, on one or two occasions, been induced to join
him in a forenoon glass of ale in the public-house of the
village.&nbsp; But one day, about noon, when Dodds had got him as
far as the public-house door, on his invitation to &ldquo;come in
and take a glass o&rsquo; yel,&rdquo; Stephenson made a dead
stop, and said, firmly, &ldquo;No, sir, you must excuse me; I
have made a resolution to drink no more at this time of
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went back.&nbsp; He desired to retain
the character of a steady workman; and the instances of men about
him who had made shipwreck of their character through
intemperance, were then, as now, unhappily but too frequent.</p>
<p>But another consideration besides his own self-improvement had
already begun to exercise an important influence on his
life.&nbsp; This was the training and education of his son
Robert, now growing up an active, intelligent boy, as full of fun
and tricks as his father had been.&nbsp; When a little fellow,
scarcely able to reach so high as to put a clock-head on when
placed upon the table, his father would make him mount a chair
for the purpose; and to &ldquo;help father&rdquo; was the
proudest work which the boy then, and ever after, could take part
in.&nbsp; When the little engine was set up at the Ochre Quarry
to pump it dry, Robert was scarcely absent for an hour.&nbsp; He
watched the machine very eagerly when it was set to work; and he
was very much annoyed at the fire burning away the grates.&nbsp;
The man who fired the engine was a sort of wag, and thinking to
get a laugh at the boy, he said, &ldquo;Those bars are getting
varra bad, Robert; I think we main cut up some of that hard wood,
and put it in instead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What would be the use
of that, you fool?&rdquo; said the boy quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
would no sooner have put them in than they would be burnt out
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So soon as Robert was of proper age, his father sent him over
to the road-side school at Long Benton, kept by Rutter, the
parish clerk.&nbsp; But the education which Rutter could give was
of a very limited kind, scarcely extending beyond the primer and
pothooks.&nbsp; While working as a brakesman on the pit-head at
Killingworth, the father had often <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>bethought him
of the obstructions he had himself encountered in life through
his want of schooling; and he formed the noble determination that
no labour, nor pains, nor self-denial on his part should be
spared to furnish his son with the best education that it was in
his power to bestow.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is true his earnings were comparatively small at that
time.&nbsp; He was still maintaining his infirm parents; and the
cost of living continued excessive.&nbsp; But he fell back upon
his old expedient of working up his spare time in the evenings at
home, or during the night shifts when it was his turn to tend the
engine, in mending and making shoes, cleaning clocks and watches,
making shoe-lasts for the shoe-makers of the neighbourhood, and
cutting out the pitmen&rsquo;s clothes for their wives; and we
have been told that to this <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>day there are
clothes worn at Killingworth made after &ldquo;Geordy
Steevie&rsquo;s cut.&rdquo;&nbsp; To give his own
words:&mdash;&ldquo;In the earlier period of my career,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;when Robert was a little boy, I saw how deficient
I was in education, and I made up my mind that he should not
labour under the same defect, but that I would put him to a good
school, and give him a liberal training.&nbsp; I was, however, a
poor man; and how do you think I managed?&nbsp; I betook myself
to mending my neighbours&rsquo; clocks and watches at nights,
after my daily labour was done, and thus I procured the means of
educating my son.&rdquo; <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a></p>
<p>Carrying out the resolution as to his boy&rsquo;s education,
Robert was sent to Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s school in Percy Street,
Newcastle, at Midsummer, 1815, when he was about twelve years
old.&nbsp; His father bought for him a donkey, on which he rode
into Newcastle and back daily; and there are many still living
who remember the little boy, dressed in his suit of homely grey
stuff, cut out by his father, cantering along to school upon the
&ldquo;cuddy,&rdquo; with his wallet of provisions for the day
and his bag of books slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>When Robert went to Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s school, he was a shy,
unpolished country lad, speaking the broad dialect of the pitmen;
and the other boys would occasionally tease him, for the purpose
of provoking an outburst of his Killingworth Doric.&nbsp; As the
shyness got rubbed off, his love of fun began to show itself, and
he was found able enough to hold his own amongst the other
boys.&nbsp; As a scholar he was steady and diligent, and his
master was accustomed to hold him up to the laggards of the
school as an example of good conduct and industry.&nbsp; But his
progress, though satisfactory, was by no means
extraordinary.&nbsp; He used in after-life to pride himself on
his achievements in mensuration, though another boy, John Taylor,
beat him at arithmetic.&nbsp; He also made <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>considerable
progress in mathematics; and in a letter written to the son of
his teacher, many years after, he said, &ldquo;It was to Mr.
Bruce&rsquo;s tuition and methods of modelling the mind that I
attribute much of my success as an engineer; for it was from him
that I derived my taste for mathematical pursuits and the
facility I possess of applying this kind of knowledge to
practical purposes and modifying it according to
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>During the time Robert attended school at Newcastle, his
father made the boy&rsquo;s education instrumental to his
own.&nbsp; Robert was accustomed to spend some of his spare time
at the rooms of the Literary and Philosophical Institute; and
when he went home in the evening, he would recount to his father
the results of his reading.&nbsp; Sometimes <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>he was
allowed to take with him to Killingworth a volume of the
&lsquo;Repertory of Arts and Sciences,&rsquo; which father and
son studied together.&nbsp; But many of the most valuable works
belonging to the Newcastle Library were not lent out; these
Robert was instructed to read and study, and bring away with him
descriptions and sketches for his father&rsquo;s
information.&nbsp; His father also practised him in reading plans
and drawings without reference to the written descriptions.&nbsp;
He used to observe that &ldquo;A good plan should always explain
itself;&rdquo; and, placing a drawing of an engine or machine
before the youth, would say, &ldquo;There, now, describe that to
me&mdash;the arrangement and the action.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he
taught him to read a drawing as easily as he would read a page of
a book.&nbsp; Both father and son profited by this excellent
practice, which enabled them to apprehend with the greatest
facility the details of even the most difficult and complicated
mechanical drawing.</p>
<p>While Robert went on with his lessons in the evenings, his
father was usually occupied with his watch and clock cleaning; or
in contriving models of pumping-engines; or endeavouring to
embody in a tangible shape the mechanical inventions which he
found described in the odd volumes on Mechanics which fell in his
way.&nbsp; This daily and unceasing example of industry and
application, in the person of a loving and beloved father,
imprinted itself deeply upon the boy&rsquo;s heart in characters
never to be effaced.&nbsp; A spirit of self-improvement was thus
early and carefully planted and fostered in Robert&rsquo;s mind,
which continued to influence him through life; and to the close
of his career, he was proud to confess that if his professional
success had been great, it was mainly to the example and training
of his father that he owed it.</p>
<p>Robert was not, however, exclusively devoted to study, but,
like most boys full of animal spirits, he was very fond of fun
and play, and sometimes of mischief.&nbsp; Dr. Bruce relates that
an old Killingworth labourer, when asked by Robert, on one of his
last visits to Newcastle, if he <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>remembered
him, replied with emotion, &ldquo;Ay, indeed!&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t
I paid your head many a time when you came with your
father&rsquo;s bait, for you were always a sad hempy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author had the pleasure, in the year 1854, of accompanying
Robert Stephenson on a visit to his old home and haunts at
Killingworth.&nbsp; He had so often travelled the road upon his
donkey to and from school, that every foot of it was familiar to
him; and each turn in it served to recall to mind some incident
of his boyish days.&nbsp; His eyes glistened when he came in
sight of Killingworth pit-head.&nbsp; Pointing to a humble
red-tiled house by the road-side at Benton, he said, &ldquo;You
see that house&mdash;that was Rutter&rsquo;s, where I learnt my A
B C, and made a beginning of my school learning.&nbsp; And
there,&rdquo; pointing to a colliery chimney on the left,
&ldquo;there is Long Benton, where my father put up his first
pumping-engine; and a great success it was.&nbsp; And this humble
clay-floored cottage you see here, is where my grandfather lived
till the close of his life.&nbsp; Many a time have I ridden
straight into the house, mounted on my cuddy, and called upon
grandfather to admire his points.&nbsp; I remember the old man
feeling the animal all over&mdash;he was then quite
blind&mdash;after which he would dilate upon the shape of his
ears, fetlocks, and quarters, and usually end by pronouncing him
to be a &lsquo;real blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was a great favourite
with the old man, who continued very fond of animals, and
cheerful to the last; and I believe nothing gave him greater
pleasure than a visit from me and my cuddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way from Benton to High Killingworth, Mr. Stephenson
pointed to a corner of the road where he had once played a boyish
trick upon a Killingworth collier.&nbsp; &ldquo;Straker,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;was a great bully, a coarse, swearing fellow, and
a perfect tyrant amongst the women and children.&nbsp; He would
go tearing into old Nanny the huxter&rsquo;s shop in the village,
and demand in a savage voice, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;r best
ham the pund?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s floor the
hunder?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What d&rsquo;ye ax for prime
bacon?&rsquo;&mdash;his questions <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>often ending
with the miserable order, accompanied with a tremendous oath, of
&lsquo;Gie&rsquo;s a penny rrow (roll) an&rsquo; a baubee
herrin!&rsquo;&nbsp; The poor woman was usually set &lsquo;all of
a shake&rsquo; by a visit from this fellow.&nbsp; He was also a
great boaster, and used to crow over the robbers whom he had put
to flight; mere men in buckram, as everybody knew.&nbsp; We
boys,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;believed him to be a great
coward, and determined to play him a trick.&nbsp; Two other boys
joined me in waylaying Straker one night at that corner,&rdquo;
pointing to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We sprang out and called upon him,
in as gruff voices as we could assume, to &lsquo;stand and
deliver!&rsquo;&nbsp; He dropped down upon his knees in the dirt,
declaring he was a poor man, with a sma&rsquo; family, asking for
&lsquo;mercy,&rsquo; and imploring us, as &lsquo;gentlemen, for
God&rsquo;s sake, t&rsquo; let him a-be!&rsquo;&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t stand this any longer, and set up a shout of
laughter.&nbsp; Recognizing our boys&rsquo; voices, he sprang to
his feet and rattled out a volley of oaths; on which we cut
through the hedge, and heard him shortly after swearing his way
along the road to the yel-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion, Robert played a series of tricks of a
somewhat different character.&nbsp; Like his father, he was very
fond of reducing his scientific reading to practice; and after
studying Franklin&rsquo;s description of the lightning
experiment, he proceeded to expend his store of Saturday pennies
in purchasing about half a mile of copper wire at a
brazier&rsquo;s shop in Newcastle.&nbsp; Having prepared his
kite, he sent it up in the field opposite his father&rsquo;s
door, and bringing the wire, insulated by means of a few feet of
silk cord, over the backs of some of Farmer Wigham&rsquo;s cows,
he soon had them skipping about the field in all directions with
their tails up.&nbsp; One day he had his kite flying at the
cottage-door as his father&rsquo;s galloway was hanging by the
bridle to the paling, waiting for the master to mount.&nbsp;
Bringing the end of the wire just over the pony&rsquo;s crupper,
so smart an electric shock was given it, that the brute was
almost knocked down.&nbsp; At this juncture the father issued
from the door, riding-whip in hand, and was witness to the
scientific trick just played off upon his galloway.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah! you mischievous scoondrel!&rdquo; cried he to the boy,
who ran off.&nbsp; He inwardly chuckled with pride, nevertheless,
at Robert&rsquo;s successful experiment. <a

<img alt=
"Stephenson&rsquo;s Cottage, West Moor"
title=
"Stephenson&rsquo;s Cottage, West Moor"
src="images/p57.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At this time, and for many years after, Stephenson dwelt in a
cottage standing by the side of the road leading from the West
Moor colliery to Killingworth.&nbsp; The railway from the West
Moor Pit crosses this road close by the east end of the
cottage.&nbsp; The dwelling originally consisted of but one
apartment on the ground-floor, with the garret <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>over-head, to
which access was obtained by means of a step-ladder.&nbsp; But
with his own hands Stephenson built an oven, and in the course of
time he added rooms to the cottage, until it became a comfortable
four-roomed dwelling, in which he lived as long as he remained at
Killingworth.</p>
<p>He continued as fond of birds and animals as ever, and seemed
to have the power of attaching them to him in a remarkable
degree.&nbsp; He had a blackbird at Killingworth so fond of him
that it would fly about the cottage, and on holding out his
finger, would come and perch upon it.&nbsp; A cage was built for
&ldquo;blackie&rdquo; in the partition between the passage and
the room, a square of glass forming its outer wall; and Robert
used afterwards to take pleasure in describing the oddity of the
bird, imitating the manner in which it would cock its head on his
father&rsquo;s entering the house, and follow him with its eye
into the inner apartment.</p>
<p>Neighbours were accustomed to call at the cottage and have
their clocks and watches set to rights when they went
wrong.&nbsp; One day, after looking at the works of a watch left
by a pitman&rsquo;s wife, George handed it to his son; &ldquo;Put
her in the oven, Robert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for a quarter of
an hour or so.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed an odd way of repairing a
watch; nevertheless, the watch was put into the oven, and at the
end of the appointed time it was taken out, going all
right.&nbsp; The wheels had merely got clogged by the oil
congealed by the cold; which at once explains the rationale of
the remedy adopted.</p>
<p>There was a little garden attached to the cottage, in which,
while a workman, Stephenson took a pride in growing gigantic
leeks and astounding cabbages.&nbsp; There was great competition
amongst the villagers in the growth of vegetables, all of whom he
excelled, excepting one of his neighbours, whose cabbages
sometimes outshone his.&nbsp; In the protection of his
garden-crops from the ravages of the birds, he invented a strange
sort of &ldquo;fley-craw,&rdquo; which moved its arms with the
wind; and he fastened his <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>garden-door
by means of a piece of ingenious mechanism, so that no one but
himself could enter it.&nbsp; His cottage was quite a
curiosity-shop of models of engines, self-acting planes, and
perpetual-motion machines.&nbsp; The last-named contrivances,
however, were only unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem which
had effectually baffled hundreds of preceding inventors.&nbsp;
His odd and eccentric contrivances often excited great wonder
amongst the Killingworth villagers.&nbsp; He won the
women&rsquo;s admiration by connecting their cradles with the
smoke-jack, and making them self-acting.&nbsp; Then he astonished
the pitmen by attaching an alarum to the clock of the watchman
whose duty it was to call them betimes in the morning.&nbsp; He
also contrived a wonderful lamp which burned under water, with
which he was afterwards wont to amuse the Brandling family at
Gosforth,&mdash;going into the fish-pond at night, lamp in hand,
attracting and catching the fish, which rushed wildly towards the
flame.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce tells of a competition which Stephenson had with the
joiner at Killingworth, as to which of them could make the best
shoe-last; and when the former had done his work, either for the
humour of the thing, or to secure fair play from the appointed
judge, he took it to the Morrisons in Newcastle, and got them to
put their stamp upon it.&nbsp; So that it is possible the
Killingworth brakesman, afterwards the inventor of the safety
lamp and the originator of the railway system, and John Morrison,
the last-maker, afterwards the translator of the Scriptures into
the Chinese language, may have confronted each other in solemn
contemplation over the successful last, which won the verdict
coveted by its maker.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would endeavour to impart to his fellow-workmen
the results of his scientific reading.&nbsp; Everything that he
learnt from books was so new and so wonderful to him, that he
regarded the facts he drew from them in the light of discoveries,
as if they had been made but yesterday.&nbsp; Once he tried to
explain to some of the pitmen how the earth was round, and kept
turning round.&nbsp; But his auditors <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>flatly
declared the thing to be impossible, as it was clear that
&ldquo;at the bottom side they must fall off!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t quite
understand it yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; His son Robert also early
endeavoured to communicate to others the information which he had
gathered at school; and Dr. Bruce has related that, when visiting
Killingworth on one occasion, he found him engaged in teaching
algebra to such of the pitmen&rsquo;s boys as would become his
pupils.</p>

<p>While Robert was still at school, his father proposed to him
during the holidays that he should construct a sun-dial, to be
placed over their cottage-door at West Moor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
expostulated with him at first,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;that I
had not learnt sufficient astronomy and mathematics to enable me
to make the necessary calculations.&nbsp; But he would have no
denial.&nbsp; &lsquo;The thing is to be done,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;so just set about it at once.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well; we got a
&lsquo;Ferguson&rsquo;s Astronomy,&rsquo; and studied the subject
together.&nbsp; Many a sore head I had while making the necessary
calculations to adapt the dial to the latitude of
Killingworth.&nbsp; But at length it was fairly drawn out on
paper, and then my father got a stone, and we hewed, and carved,
and polished it, until we made a very respectable dial of it; and
there it is, you see,&rdquo; pointing to it over the
cottage-door, &ldquo;still quietly numbering the hours when the
sun is shining.&nbsp; I assure you, not a little was thought of
that piece of work by the pitmen when it was put up, and began to
tell its tale of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The date carved upon the dial
is &ldquo;August 11th, MDCCCXVI.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>father and son were in after-life very proud of the
joint production.&nbsp; Many years after, George took a party of
savans, when attending the meeting of the British Association at
Newcastle, over to Killingworth to see the pits, and he did not
fail to direct their attention to the sun-dial; and Robert, on
the last visit which he made to the place, a short time before
his death, took a friend into the cottage, and pointed out to him
the very desk, still there, at which he had sat while making his
calculations of the latitude of Killingworth.</p>
<p>From the time of his appointment as engineer at the
Killingworth Pit, George Stephenson was in a measure relieved
from the daily routine of manual labour, having, as we have seen,
advanced himself to the grade of a higher class workman.&nbsp;
But he had not ceased to be a worker, though he employed his
industry in a different way.&nbsp; It might, indeed, be inferred
that he had now the command of greater leisure; but his spare
hours were as much as ever given to work, either necessary or
self-imposed.&nbsp; So far as regarded his social position, he
had already reached the summit of his ambition; and when he had
got his hundred a year, and his dun galloway to ride on, he said
he never wanted to be any higher.&nbsp; When Robert Whetherly
offered to give him an old gig, his travelling having so much
increased of late, he accepted it with great reluctance,
observing, that he should be ashamed to get into it,
&ldquo;people would think him so proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the High Pit had been sunk, and the coal was ready for
working, Stephenson erected his first winding-engine to draw the
coals out of the pit, and also a pumping-engine for Long Benton
Colliery, both of which proved quite successful.&nbsp; Amongst
other works of this time, he projected and laid down a
self-acting incline along the declivity which fell towards the
coal-loading place near Willington, where he had officiated as
brakesman; and he so arranged it, that the full waggons
descending drew the empty waggons up the railroad.&nbsp; This was
one of the first self-acting inclines laid down in the
district.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Stephenson had now much better opportunities than
hitherto for improving himself in mechanics.&nbsp; His familiar
acquaintance with the steam-engine proved of great value to
him.&nbsp; His shrewd insight, and his intimate practical
acquaintance with its mechanism, enabled him to apprehend, as if
by intuition, its most abstruse and difficult combinations.&nbsp;
The practical study which he had given to it when a workman, and
the patient manner in which he had groped his way through all the
details of the machine, gave him the power of a master in dealing
with it as applied to colliery purposes.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Liddell was frequently about the works, and took
pleasure in giving every encouragement to the engine-wright in
his efforts after improvement.&nbsp; The subject of the
locomotive engine was already closely occupying
Stephenson&rsquo;s attention; although it was still regarded as a
curious and costly toy, of comparatively little real use.&nbsp;
But he had at an early period detected its practical value, and
formed an adequate conception of the might which as yet slumbered
within it; and he now bent his entire faculties to the
development of its extraordinary powers.</p>

<span class="smcap">Early History of the
Locomotive</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Stephenson
begins its Improvement</span>.</h2>
<p>The rapid increase in the coal-trade of the Tyne about the
beginning of the present century had the effect of stimulating
the ingenuity of mechanics, and encouraging them to devise
improved methods of transporting the coal from the pits to the
shipping places.&nbsp; From our introductory chapter, it will
have been observed that the improvements which had thus far been
effected were confined almost entirely to the road.&nbsp; The
railway waggons still continued to be drawn by horses.&nbsp; By
improving and flattening the tramway, considerable economy in
horse-power had indeed been secured; but unless some more
effective method of mechanical traction could be devised, it was
clear that railway improvement had almost reached its limits.</p>
<p>Many expedients had been tried with this object.&nbsp; One of
the earliest was that of hoisting sails upon the waggons, and
driving them along the waggon-way, as a ship is driven through
the water by the wind.&nbsp; This method seems to have been
employed by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, an ingenious coal-miner at
Neath in Glamorganshire, about the end of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>After having been lost sight of for more than a century, the
same plan of impelling carriages was revived by Richard Lovell
Edgworth, with the addition of a portable railway, since revived
also, in Boydell&rsquo;s patent.&nbsp; But although Mr. Edgworth
devoted himself to the subject for many years, he failed in
securing the adoption of his sailing carriage.&nbsp; It is indeed
quite clear that a power so uncertain as wind could never be
relied on for ordinary traffic, and <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Mr.
Edgworth&rsquo;s project was consequently left to repose in the
limbo of the Patent Office, with thousands of other equally
useless though ingenious contrivances.</p>
<p>A much more favourite scheme was the application of steam
power for the purpose of carriage traction.&nbsp; Savery, the
inventor of the working steam-engine, was the first to propose
its employment to propel vehicles along the common roads; and in
1759 Dr. Robison, then a young man studying at Glasgow College,
threw out the same idea to his friend James Watt; but the scheme
was not matured.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The first locomotive steam-carriage was built at Paris by the
French engineer Cugnot, a native of Lorraine.&nbsp; It is said to
have been invented for the purpose of dragging cannon into the
field independent of horses.&nbsp; The original model of this
machine was made in 1763.&nbsp; Count Saxe was so much pleased
with it, that on his recommendation a full-sized engine was
constructed at the cost of the French monarch; and in 1769 it was
tried in the presence of the Duc de Choiseul, Minister of War,
General Gribeauval, and other officers.&nbsp; At one of the
experiments it ran with such force as to knock down a wall in its
way.&nbsp; But the new vehicle, loaded with four persons, could
not travel faster than two and a half miles an hour.&nbsp; The
boiler was insufficient in size, and it could only work for about
fifteen minutes; after which it was necessary to wait until the
steam had again risen to a sufficient pressure.&nbsp; To remedy
this defect, Cugnot constructed a new machine in 1770, <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the
working of which was more satisfactory.&nbsp; It was composed of
two parts&mdash;the fore part consisting of a small steam-engine,
formed of a round copper boiler, with a furnace inside, provided
with two small chimneys and two single-acting brass steam
cylinders, whose pistons acted alternately upon the single
driving-wheel.&nbsp; The hinder part consisted merely of a rude
carriage on two wheels to carry the load, furnished with a seat
in front for the conductor.&nbsp; This engine was tried in the
streets of Paris; but when passing near where the Madeleine now
stands, it overbalanced itself on turning a corner, and fell over
with a crash; after which, its employment being thought
dangerous, it was locked up in the arsenal to prevent further
mischief.&nbsp; The machine is, however, still to be seen in the
collection of the Conservatoire des Arts et M&eacute;tiers at
Paris.&nbsp; It has very much the look of a long brewer&rsquo;s
cart, with the addition of the circular boiler hung on at one
end.&nbsp; Rough though it looks, it was a highly creditable
piece of work, considering the period at which it was executed;
and as the first actual machine constructed for the purpose of
travelling on ordinary roads by the power of steam, it is
certainly a most curious and interesting mechanical relic, well
worthy of preservation.</p>
<p>But though Cugnot&rsquo;s road locomotive remained locked up
from public sight, the subject was not dead; for we find
inventors employing themselves from time to time in attempting to
solve the problem of steam locomotion in places far remote from
Paris.&nbsp; The idea had taken root in the minds of inventors,
and was striving to grow into a reality.&nbsp; Thus Oliver Evans,
the American, invented a steam carriage in 1772 to travel on
common roads; in 1787 he obtained from the State of Maryland an
exclusive right to make and use steam-carriages, but his
invention never came into use.&nbsp; Then, in 1784, William
Symington, one of the early inventors of the steamboat, was
similarly occupied in Scotland in endeavouring to develop the
latent powers of the steam-carriage.&nbsp; He had a working model
of one <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>constructed, which he exhibited in
1786 to the professors of Edinburgh College; but the state of the
Scotch roads was then so bad that he found it impracticable to
proceed further with his scheme, which he shortly after abandoned
in favour of steam navigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p66.jpg">
<img alt=
"Section of Murdock&rsquo;s Model"
title=
"Section of Murdock&rsquo;s Model"
src="images/p66.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The same year in which Symington was occupied upon his
steam-carriage, William Murdock, the friend and assistant of
Watt, constructed his model of a locomotive at the opposite end
of the island&mdash;at Redruth in Cornwall.&nbsp; His model was
of small dimensions, standing little more than a foot high; and
it was until recently in the possession of the son of the
inventor, at whose house we saw it a few years ago.&nbsp; The
annexed section will give an idea of the arrangements of this
machine.</p>
<p>It acted on the high-pressure principle, and, like
Cugnot&rsquo;s engine, ran upon three wheels, the boiler being
heated by a spirit-lamp.&nbsp; Small though the machine was, it
went so fast on one occasion that it fairly outran its
inventor.&nbsp; It seems that one night after returning from his
duties at the Redruth mine, Murdock determined to try the working
of his model locomotive.&nbsp; For this purpose he had recourse
to the walk leading to the church, about a mile from the
town.&nbsp; It was rather narrow, and was bounded on each side by
high hedges.&nbsp; The night was dark, and Murdock set out alone
to try his experiment.&nbsp; Having lit his lamp, the water
boiled speedily, and off started the engine with the inventor
after it.&nbsp; He soon heard distant shouts of terror.&nbsp; It
was too dark to perceive objects; but he found, on following up
the machine, that the cries proceeded from the worthy pastor of
the parish, who, going towards the town, was met on this lonely
road by the hissing and fiery little <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>monster,
which he subsequently declared he had taken to be the Evil One
<i>in propri&aacute; person&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; No further steps
were, however, taken by Murdock to embody his idea of a
locomotive carriage in a more practical form.</p>
<p>The idea was next taken up by Murdock&rsquo;s pupil, Richard
Trevithick, who resolved on building a steam-carriage adapted for
common roads as well as railways.&nbsp; He took out a patent to
secure the right of his invention in 1802.&nbsp; Andrew Vivian,
his cousin, joined with him in the patent&mdash;Vivian finding
the money, and Trevithick the brains.&nbsp; The steam-carriage
built on this patent presented the appearance of an ordinary
stage-coach on four wheels.&nbsp; The engine had one horizontal
cylinder, which, together with the boiler and the furnace-box,
was placed in the rear of the hind axle.&nbsp; The motion of the
piston was transmitted to a separate crank-axle, from which,
through the medium of spur-gear, the axle of the driving-wheel
(which was mounted with a fly-wheel) derived its motion.&nbsp;
The steam-cocks and the force-pump, as also the bellows used for
the purpose of quickening combustion in the furnace, were worked
off the same crank-axle.</p>
<p>John Petherick, of Camborne, has related that he remembers
this first English steam-coach passing along the principal street
of his native town.&nbsp; Considerable difficulty was experienced
in keeping up the pressure of steam; but when there was pressure
enough, Trevithick would call upon the people to &ldquo;jump
up,&rdquo; so as to create a load upon the engine.&nbsp; It was
soon covered with men attracted by the novelty, nor did their
number seem to make any difference in the speed of the engine so
long as there was steam enough; but it was constantly running
short, and the horizontal bellows failed to keep it up.</p>
<p>This road-locomotive of Trevithick&rsquo;s was one of the
first high-pressure working engines constructed on the principle
of moving a piston by the elasticity of steam against the
pressure only of the atmosphere.&nbsp; Such an engine had been
described by Leopold, though in his apparatus it was <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>proposed that the pressure should act only on one side
of the piston.&nbsp; In Trevithick&rsquo;s engine the piston was
not only raised, but was also depressed by the action of the
steam, being in this respect an entirely original invention, and
of great merit.&nbsp; The steam was admitted from the boiler
under the piston moving in a cylinder, impelling it upward.&nbsp;
When the motion had reached its limit, the communication between
the piston and the under side was shut off, and the steam allowed
to escape into the atmosphere.&nbsp; A passage being then opened
between the boiler and the upper side of the piston, which was
pressed downwards, the steam was again allowed to escape as
before.&nbsp; Thus the power of the engine was equal to the
difference between the pressure of the atmosphere and the
elasticity of the steam in the boiler.</p>
<p>This steam-carriage excited considerable interest in the
remote district near the Land&rsquo;s End where it had been
erected.&nbsp; Being so far removed from the great movements and
enterprise of the commercial world, Trevithick and Vivian
determined upon exhibiting their machine in the metropolis.&nbsp;
They accordingly set out with it to Plymouth, whence it was
conveyed by sea to London.</p>
<p>The carriage safely reached the metropolis, and excited much
public interest.&nbsp; It also attracted the notice of scientific
men, amongst others of Mr. Davies Gilbert, President of the Royal
Society, and Sir Humphry Davy, both Cornishmen like Trevithick,
who went to see the private performances of the engine, and were
greatly pleased with it.&nbsp; Writing to a Cornish friend
shortly after its arrival in town, Sir Humphry said: &ldquo;I
shall soon hope to hear that the roads of England are the haunts
of Captain Trevithick&rsquo;s dragons&mdash;a characteristic
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; The machine was afterwards publicly exhibited
in an enclosed piece of ground near Euston Square, where the
London and North-Western Station now stands, and it dragged
behind it a wheel-carriage full of passengers.&nbsp; On the
second day of the performance, crowds flocked to see it; but
Trevithick, <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>in one of his odd freaks, shut up the
place, and shortly after removed the engine.&nbsp; It is,
however, probable that the inventor came to the conclusion that
the state of the roads at that time was such as to preclude its
coming into general use for purposes of ordinary traffic.</p>
<p>While the steam-carriage was being exhibited, a gentleman was
laying heavy wagers as to the weight which could be hauled by a
single horse on the Wandsworth and Croydon iron tramway; and the
number and weight of waggons drawn by the horse were something
surprising.&nbsp; Trevithick very probably put the two things
together&mdash;the steam-horse and the iron-way&mdash;and kept
the performance in mind when he proceeded to construct his second
or railway locomotive.&nbsp; The idea was not, however, entirely
new to him; for, although his first engine had been constructed
with a view to its employment upon common roads, the
specification of his patent distinctly alludes to the application
of his engine to travelling on railroads.&nbsp; Having been
employed at the iron-works of Pen-y-darran, in South Wales, to
erect a forge engine for the Company, a convenient opportunity
presented itself, on the completion of this work, for carrying
out his design of a locomotive to haul the minerals along the
Pen-y-darran tramway.&nbsp; Such an engine was erected by him in
1803, in the blacksmiths&rsquo; shop at the Company&rsquo;s
works, and it was finished and ready for trial before the end of
the year.</p>
<p>The boiler of this second engine was cylindrical in form, flat
at the ends, and made of wrought iron.&nbsp; The furnace and flue
were inside the boiler, within which the single cylinder, eight
inches in diameter and four feet six inches stroke, was placed
horizontally.&nbsp; As in the first engine, the motion of the
wheels was produced by spur gear, to which was also added a
fly-wheel on one side, to secure a rotatory motion in the crank
at the end of each stroke of the piston in the single
cylinder.&nbsp; The waste steam was thrown into the chimney
through a tube inserted into it at right angles; but it will be
obvious that this arrangement was not calculated <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>to
produce any result in the way of a steam-blast in the
chimney.&nbsp; In fact, the waste steam seems to have been turned
into the chimney in order to get rid of the nuisance caused by
throwing the jet directly into the air.&nbsp; Trevithick was here
hovering on the verge of a great discovery; but that he was not
aware of the action of the blast in contributing to increase the
draught and thus quicken combustion, is clear from the fact that
he employed bellows for this special purpose; and at a much later
date (1815) he took out a patent which included a method of
urging the fire by means of fanners. <a name="citation70"></a><a

<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>At the first trial of this engine it succeeded in
dragging after it several waggons, containing ten tons of
bar-iron, at the rate of about five miles an hour.&nbsp; Rees
Jones, who worked at the fitting of the engine, and remembers its
performances, says, &ldquo;She was used for bringing down metal
from the furnaces to the Old Forge.&nbsp; She worked very well;
but frequently, from her weight, broke the tram-plates and the
hooks between the trams.&nbsp; After working for some time in
this way, she took a load of iron from Pen-y-darran down the
Basin-road, upon which road she was intended to work.&nbsp; On
the journey she broke a great many of the tram-plates, and before
reaching the basin ran off the road, and had to be brought back
to Pen-y-darran by horses.&nbsp; The engine was never after used
as a locomotive.&rdquo; <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a></p>
<p>It seems to have been felt that unless the road were entirely
reconstructed so as to bear the heavy weight of the
locomotive&mdash;so much greater than that of the tram-waggons,
to carry which the original rails had been laid down&mdash;the
regular employment of Trevithick&rsquo;s high-pressure
tram-engine was altogether impracticable; and as the owners of
the works were not prepared to incur so serious a cost, it was
determined to take the locomotive off the road, and employ it as
an engine for other purposes.&nbsp; It was accordingly
dismounted, and used for some time after as a pumping-engine, for
which purpose it was found well adapted.&nbsp; Trevithick himself
seems from this time to have taken no further steps to bring the
locomotive into general use.&nbsp; We find him, shortly after,
engaged upon schemes of a more promising character, abandoning
the engine to other <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>mechanical inventors, though little
improvement was made in it for several years.&nbsp; An imaginary
difficulty seems to have tended, amongst other obstacles, to
prevent its adoption; viz., the idea that, if a heavy weight were
placed behind the engine, the &ldquo;grip&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bite&rdquo; of its smooth wheels upon the equally smooth
iron rail, must necessarily be so slight that they would whirl
round upon it, and, consequently, that the machine would not make
progress.&nbsp; Hence Trevithick, in his patent, provided that
the periphery of the driving-wheels should be made rough by the
projection of bolts or cross-grooves, so that the adhesion of the
wheels to the road might be secured.</p>
<p>Following up the presumed necessity for a more effectual
adhesion between the wheels and the rails, Mr. Blenkinsop of
Leeds, in 1811, took out a patent for a racked or tooth-rail laid
along one side of the road, into which the toothed-wheel of his
locomotive worked as pinions work into a rack.&nbsp; The boiler
of his engine was supported by a carriage with four wheels
without teeth, and rested immediately upon the axles.&nbsp; These
wheels were entirely independent of the working parts of the
engine, and therefore merely supported its weight upon the rails,
the progress being effected by means of the cogged-wheel working
into the cogged-rail.&nbsp; The engine had two cylinders, instead
of one as in Trevithick&rsquo;s engine.&nbsp; The invention of
the double cylinder was due to Matthew Murray, of Leeds, one of
the best mechanical engineers of his time; Mr. Blenkinsop, who
was not a mechanic, having consulted him as to all the practical
arrangements.&nbsp; The connecting-rods gave the motion to two
pinions by cranks at right angles to each other; these pinions
communicating the motion to the wheel which worked into the
cogged-rail.</p>
<p>Mr. Blenkinsop&rsquo;s engines began running on the railway
from the Middleton Collieries to Leeds, about 3&frac12; miles, on
the 12th of August, 1812.&nbsp; They continued for many years to
be one of the principal curiosities of the place, and were
visited by strangers from all parts.&nbsp; In 1816, the <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Grand
Duke Nicholas (afterwards Emperor) of Russia observed the working
of Blenkinsop&rsquo;s locomotive with curious interest and
admiration.&nbsp; An engine dragged as many as thirty
coal-waggons at a speed of about 3&frac14; miles per hour.&nbsp;
These engines continued for many years to be thus employed in the
haulage of coal, and furnished the first instance of the regular
employment of locomotive power for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Chapman, of Newcastle, in 1812, endeavoured to
overcome the same fictitious difficulty of the want of adhesion
between the wheel and the rail, by patenting a locomotive to work
along the road by means of a chain stretched from one end of it
to the other.&nbsp; This chain was passed once round a grooved
barrel-wheel under the centre of the engine: so that, when the
wheel turned, the locomotive, as it were, dragged itself along
the railway.&nbsp; An engine, constructed after this plan, was
tried on the Heaton Railway, near Newcastle; but it was so clumsy
in its action, there was so great a loss of power by friction,
and it was found to be so expensive and difficult to keep in
repair, that it was soon abandoned.&nbsp; Another remarkable
expedient was adopted by Mr. Brunton, of the Butterley Works,
Derbyshire, who, in 1813, patented his Mechanical Traveller, to
go <i>upon legs</i> working alternately like those of a horse. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; But this engine never got beyond
the experimental state, for, at its very first trial, the driver,
to make sure of a good start, overloaded the safety-valve, when
the boiler burst and killed a number of the bystanders, wounding
many more.&nbsp; These, and other contrivances with the same
object, projected about the same time, show that invention was
actively at work, and that many minds were anxiously <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>labouring to solve the important problem of locomotive
traction upon railways.</p>
<p>But the difficulties contended with by these early inventors,
and the step-by-step progress which they made, will probably be
best illustrated by the experiments conducted by Mr. Blackett, of
Wylam, which are all the more worthy of notice, as the
persevering efforts of this gentleman in a great measure paved
the way for the labours of George Stephenson, who, shortly after,
took up the question of steam locomotion, and brought it to a
successful issue.</p>
<p>The Wylam waggon-way is one of the oldest in the north of
England.&nbsp; Down to the year 1807 it was formed of wooden
spars or rails, laid down between the colliery at
Wylam&mdash;where old Robert Stephenson had worked&mdash;and the
village of Lemington, some four miles down the Tyne, where the
coals were loaded into keels or barges, and floated down past
Newcastle, to be shipped for London.&nbsp; Each chaldron-waggon
had a man in charge of it, and was originally drawn by one
horse.&nbsp; The rate at which the waggons were hauled was so
slow that only two journeys were performed by each man and horse
in one day, and three on the day following.&nbsp; This primitive
waggon-way passed, as before stated, close in front of the
cottage in which George Stephenson was born; and one of the
earliest sights which met his infant eyes was this wooden
tramroad worked by horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Blackett was the first colliery owner in the North who
took an active interest in the locomotive.&nbsp; Having formed
the acquaintance of Trevithick in London, and inspected the
performances of his engine, he determined to repeat the
Pen-y-darran experiment upon the Wylam waggon-way.&nbsp; He
accordingly obtained from Trevithick, in October, 1804, a plan of
his engine, provided with &ldquo;friction-wheels,&rdquo; and
employed Mr. John Whinfield, of Pipewellgate, Gateshead, to
construct it at his foundry there.&nbsp; The engine was
constructed under the superintendence of one John Steele, an
ingenious mechanic who had been in <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Wales, and
worked under Trevithick in fitting the engine at
Pen-y-darran.&nbsp; When the Gateshead locomotive was finished, a
temporary way was laid down in the works, on which it was run
backwards and forwards many times.&nbsp; For some reason,
however&mdash;it is said because the engine was deemed too light
for drawing the coal-trains&mdash;it never left the works, but
was dismounted from the wheels, and set to blow the cupola of the
foundry, in which service it long continued to be employed.</p>
<p>Several years elapsed before Mr. Blackett took any further
steps to carry out his idea.&nbsp; The final abandonment of
Trevithick&rsquo;s locomotive at Pen-y-darran perhaps contributed
to deter him from proceeding further; but he had the wooden
tramway taken up in 1808, and a plate-way of cast-iron laid down
instead&mdash;a single line furnished with sidings to enable the
laden waggons to pass the empty ones.&nbsp; The new iron road
proved so much smoother than the old wooden one, that a single
horse, instead of drawing one, was now enabled to draw two, or
even three, laden waggons.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of Mr. Blenkinsop&rsquo;s experiment
at Leeds, Mr. Blackett determined to follow his example; and in
1812 he ordered a second engine, to work with a toothed
driving-wheel upon a rack-rail.&nbsp; This locomotive was
constructed by Thomas Waters, of Gateshead, under the
superintendence of Jonathan Foster, Mr. Blackett&rsquo;s
principal engine-wright.&nbsp; It was a combination of
Trevithick&rsquo;s and Blenkinsop&rsquo;s engines; but it was of
a more awkward construction than either.&nbsp; The boiler was of
cast-iron.&nbsp; The engine was provided with a single cylinder
six inches in diameter, with a fly-wheel working at one side to
carry the crank over the dead points.&nbsp; Jonathan Foster
described it to the author in 1854, as &ldquo;a strange machine,
with lots of pumps, cog-wheels, and plugs, requiring constant
attention while at work.&rdquo;&nbsp; The weight of the whole was
about six tons.</p>
<p>When finished, it was conveyed to Wylam on a waggon, <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>and
there mounted upon a wooden frame supported by four pairs of
wheels, which had been constructed for its reception.&nbsp; A
barrel of water, placed on another frame upon wheels, was
attached to it as a tender.&nbsp; After a great deal of labour,
the cumbrous machine was got upon the road.&nbsp; At first it
would not move an inch.&nbsp; Its maker, Tommy Waters, became
impatient, and at length enraged, and taking hold of the lever of
the safety valve, declared in his desperation, that &ldquo;either
<i>she</i> or <i>he</i> should go.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length the
machinery was set in motion, on which, as Jonathan Foster
described to the author &ldquo;she flew all to pieces, and it was
the biggest wonder i&rsquo; the world that we were not all blewn
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The incompetent and useless engine was declared
to be a failure; it was shortly after dismounted and sold; and
Mr. Blackett&rsquo;s praiseworthy efforts thus far proved in
vain.</p>
<p>He was still, however, desirous of testing the practicability
of employing locomotive power in working the coal down to
Lemington, and he determined on another trial.&nbsp; He
accordingly directed his engine-wright to proceed with the
building of a third engine in the Wylam workshops.&nbsp; This new
locomotive had a single 8-inch cylinder, was provided with a
fly-wheel like its predecessor, and the driving-wheel was cogged
on one side to enable it to travel in the rack-rail laid along
the road.&nbsp; This engine proved more successful than the
former one; and it was found capable of dragging eight or nine
loaded waggons, though at the rate of little more than a mile an
hour, from the colliery to the shipping-place.&nbsp; It sometimes
took six hours to perform the journey of five miles.&nbsp; Its
weight was found too great for the road, and the cast-iron plates
were constantly breaking.&nbsp; It was also very apt to get off
the rack-rail, and then it stood still.&nbsp; The driver was one
day asked how he got on?&nbsp; &ldquo;Get on?&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t get on; we only get off!&rdquo;&nbsp; On
such occasions, horses had to be sent to drag the waggons as
before, and others to haul the engine back to the
work-shops.&nbsp; It was constantly getting out of order; its
plugs, <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>pumps, or cranks, got wrong; it was
under repair as often as at work; at length it became so cranky
that the horses were usually sent out after it to drag it when it
gave up; and the workmen generally declared it to be a
&ldquo;perfect plague.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Blackett did not obtain
credit amongst his neighbours for these experiments.&nbsp; Many
laughed at his machines, regarding them only in the light of
crotchets,&mdash;frequently quoting the proverb that &ldquo;a
fool and his money are soon parted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others regarded
them as absurd innovations on the established method of hauling
coal; and pronounced that they would &ldquo;never
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, however, the comparative failure of this
second locomotive, Mr. Blackett persevered with his
experiments.&nbsp; He was zealously assisted by Jonathan Foster
the engine-wright, and William Hedley, the viewer of the
colliery, a highly ingenious person, who proved of great use in
carrying out the experiments to a successful issue.&nbsp; One of
the chief causes of failure being the rack-rail, the idea
occurred to Mr. Hedley that it might be possible to secure
adhesion enough between the wheel and the rail by the mere weight
of the engine, and he proceeded to make a series of experiments
for the purpose of determining this problem.&nbsp; He had a frame
placed on four wheels, and fitted up with windlasses attached by
gearing to the several wheels.&nbsp; The frame having been
properly weighted, six men were set to work the windlasses; when
it was found that the adhesion of the smooth wheels on the smooth
rails was quite sufficient to enable them to propel the machine
without slipping.&nbsp; Having found the proportion which the
power bore to the weight, he demonstrated by successive
experiments that the weight of the engine would of itself produce
sufficient adhesion to enable it to draw upon a smooth railroad
the requisite number of waggons in all kinds of weather.&nbsp;
And thus was the fallacy which had heretofore prevailed on this
subject completely exploded, and it was satisfactorily proved
that rack-rails, toothed wheels, endless chains, and legs, were
alike unnecessary for <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the efficient traction of loaded
waggons upon a moderately level road.</p>
<p>From this time forward considerably less difficulty was
experienced in working the coal trains upon the Wylam
tramroad.&nbsp; At length the rack-rail was dispensed with.&nbsp;
The road was laid with heavier rails; the working of the old
engine was improved; and a new engine was shortly after built and
placed upon the road, still on eight wheels, driven by seven
rack-wheels working inside them&mdash;with a wrought-iron boiler
through which the flue was returned so as largely to increase the
heating surface, and thus give increased power to the engine.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As may readily be imagined, the jets of steam from the piston,
blowing off into the air at high pressure while the engine was in
motion, caused considerable annoyance to horses passing along the
Wylam road, at that time a public <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>highway.&nbsp; The nuisance was felt to be almost
intolerable, and a neighbouring gentleman threatened to have it
put down.&nbsp; To diminish the noise as much as possible, Mr.
Blackett gave orders that so soon as any horse, or horses, came
in sight, the locomotive was to be stopped, and the frightful
blast of the engine thus suspended until the passing animals had
got out of hearing.&nbsp; Much interruption was thus caused to
the working of the railway, and it excited considerable
dissatisfaction amongst the workmen.&nbsp; The following plan was
adopted to abate the nuisance: a reservoir was provided
immediately behind the chimney (as shown in the preceding cut)
into which the waste steam was thrown after it had performed its
office in the cylinder; and from this reservoir, the steam
gradually escaped into the atmosphere without noise.</p>
<p>While Mr. Blackett was thus experimenting and building
locomotives at Wylam, George Stephenson was anxiously studying
the same subject at Killingworth.&nbsp; He was no sooner
appointed engine-wright of the collieries than his attention was
directed to the means of more economically hauling the coal from
the pits to the river-side.&nbsp; We have seen that one of the
first important improvements which he made, after being placed in
charge of the colliery machinery, was to apply the surplus power
of a pumping steam-engine, fixed underground, to drawing the
coals out of the deeper workings of the Killingworth
mines,&mdash;by which he succeeded in effecting a large reduction
in the expenditure on manual and horse labour.</p>
<p>The coals, when brought above ground, had next to be
laboriously dragged by horses to the shipping staiths on the
Tyne, several miles distant.&nbsp; The adoption of a tramroad, it
is true, had tended to facilitate their transit.&nbsp;
Nevertheless the haulage was both tedious and costly.&nbsp; With
the view of economising labour, Stephenson laid down inclined
planes where the nature of the ground would admit of this
expedient.&nbsp; Thus, a train of full waggons let down the
incline by means of a rope running over wheels laid along <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>the tramroad, the other end of which was attached to a
train of empty waggons placed at the bottom of the parallel road
on the same incline, dragged them up by the simple power of
gravity.&nbsp; But this applied only to a comparatively small
part of the road.&nbsp; An economical method of working the coal
trains, instead of by horses,&mdash;the keep of which was at that
time very costly, from the high price of corn,&mdash;was still a
great desideratum; and the best practical minds in the collieries
were actively engaged in the attempt to solve the problem.</p>
<p>In the first place Stephenson resolved to make himself
thoroughly acquainted with what had already been done.&nbsp; Mr.
Blackett&rsquo;s engines were working daily at Wylam, past the
cottage where he had been born; and thither he frequently went to
inspect the improvements made by Mr. Blackett from time to time
both in the locomotive and in the plateway along which it
worked.&nbsp; Jonathan Foster informed us that, after one of
these visits, Stephenson declared to him his conviction that a
much more effective engine might be made, that should work more
steadily and draw the load more effectively.</p>
<p>He had also the advantage, about the same time, of seeing one
of Blenkinsop&rsquo;s Leeds engines, which was placed on the
tramway leading from the collieries of Kenton and Coxlodge, on
the 2nd September, 1813.&nbsp; This locomotive drew sixteen
chaldron waggons containing an aggregate weight of seventy tons,
at the rate of about three miles an hour.&nbsp; George Stephenson
and several of the Killingworth men were amongst the crowd of
spectators that day; and after examining the engine and observing
its performances, he observed to his companions, that &ldquo;he
thought he could make a better engine than that, to go upon
legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably he had heard of the invention of
Brunton, whose patent had by this time been published, and proved
the subject of much curious speculation in the colliery
districts.&nbsp; Certain it is, that, shortly after the
inspection of the Coxlodge engine, he contemplated the
construction of a new <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>locomotive, which was to surpass all
that had preceded it.&nbsp; He observed that those engines which
had been constructed up to this time, however ingenious in their
arrangements, had proved practical failures.&nbsp; Mr.
Blackett&rsquo;s was as yet both clumsy and expensive.&nbsp;
Chapman&rsquo;s had been removed from the Heaton tramway in 1812,
and was regarded as a total failure.&nbsp; And the Blenkinsop
engine at Coxlodge was found very unsteady and costly in its
working; besides, it pulled the rails to pieces, the entire
strain being upon the rack-rail on one side of the road.&nbsp;
The boiler, however, having soon after blown up, there was an end
of that engine; and the colliery owners did not feel encouraged
to try any further experiment.</p>
<p>An efficient and economical working locomotive, therefore,
still remained to be invented; and to accomplish this object Mr.
Stephenson now applied himself.&nbsp; Profiting by what his
predecessors had done, warned by their failures and encouraged by
their partial successes, he commenced his labours.&nbsp; There
was still wanting the man who should accomplish for the
locomotive what James Watt had done for the steam-engine, and
combine in a complete form the best points in the separate plans
of others, embodying with them such original inventions and
adaptations of his own as to entitle him to the merit of
inventing the working locomotive, in the same manner as James
Watt is to be regarded as the inventor of the working
condensing-engine.&nbsp; This was the great work upon which
George Stephenson now entered, though probably without any
adequate idea of the ultimate importance of his labours to
society and civilization.</p>
<p>He proceeded to bring the subject of constructing a
&ldquo;Travelling Engine,&rdquo; as he then denominated the
locomotive, under the notice of the lessees of the Killingworth
Colliery, in the year 1813.&nbsp; Lord Ravensworth, the principal
partner, had already formed a very favourable opinion of the new
engine-wright, from the improvements which he had effected in the
colliery engines, both above and below <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>ground; and,
after considering the matter, and hearing Stephenson&rsquo;s
explanations, he authorised him to proceed with the construction
of a locomotive,&mdash;though his lordship was, by some, called a
fool for advancing money for such a purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
first locomotive that I made,&rdquo; said Stephenson, many years
after, <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a> when speaking of his early career at a
public meeting in Newcastle, &ldquo;was at Killingworth Colliery,
and with Lord Ravensworth&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; Yes; Lord
Ravensworth and partners were the first to entrust me, thirty-two
years since, with money to make a locomotive engine.&nbsp; I said
to my friends, there was no limit to the speed of such an engine,
if the works could be made to stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our engine-wright had, however, many obstacles to encounter
before he could get fairly to work with the erection of his
locomotive.&nbsp; His chief difficulty was in finding workmen
sufficiently skilled in mechanics, and in the use of tools, to
follow his instructions and embody his designs in a practical
shape.&nbsp; The tools then in use about the collieries were rude
and clumsy; and there were no such facilities as now exist for
turning out machinery of an entirely new character.&nbsp;
Stephenson was under the necessity of working with such men and
tools as were at his command; and he had in a great measure to
train and instruct the workmen himself.&nbsp; The engine was
built in the workshops at the West Moor, the leading mechanic
employed being the colliery blacksmith, an excellent workman in
his way, though quite new to the work now entrusted to him.</p>
<p>In this first locomotive constructed at Killingworth,
Stephenson to some extent followed the plan of Blenkinsop&rsquo;s
engine.&nbsp; The boiler was cylindrical, of wrought iron, 8 feet
in length and 34 inches in diameter, with an internal flue-tube
20 inches wide passing through it.&nbsp; The engine <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>had
two vertical cylinders of 8 inches diameter, and 2 feet stroke,
let into the boiler, working the propelling gear with cross heads
and connecting rods.&nbsp; The power of the two cylinders was
combined by means of spurwheels, which communicated the motive
power to the wheels supporting the engine on the rail, instead
of, as in Blenkinsop&rsquo;s engine, to cogwheels which acted on
the cogged rail independent of the four supporting wheels.&nbsp;
The engine thus worked upon what is termed the second
motion.&nbsp; The chimney was of wrought iron, round which was a
chamber extending back to the feed-pumps, for the purpose of
heating the water previous to its injection into the
boiler.&nbsp; The engine had no springs, and was mounted on a
wooden frame supported on four wheels.&nbsp; In order to
neutralise as much as possible the jolts and shocks which such an
engine would necessarily encounter from the obstacles and
inequalities of the then very imperfect plateway, the
water-barrel which served for a tender was fixed to the end of a
lever and weighted, the other end of the lever being connected
with the frame of the locomotive carriage.&nbsp; By this means
the weight of the two was more equally distributed, though the
contrivance did not by any means compensate for the absence of
springs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The wheels of the locomotive were all smooth, Mr. Stephenson
having satisfied himself by experiment that the adhesion between
the wheels of a loaded engine and the rail would be sufficient
for the purpose of traction.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson informed us
that his father caused a number of workmen to mount upon the
wheels of a waggon moderately loaded, and throw their entire
weight upon the spokes on one side, when he found that the waggon
could thus be easily propelled forward without the wheels
slipping.&nbsp; This, together with other experiments, satisfied
him <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>of the expediency of adopting smooth wheels on his
engine, and it was so finished accordingly.</p>
<p>The engine was, after much labour and anxiety, and frequent
alterations of parts, at length brought to completion, having
been about ten months in hand.&nbsp; It was placed upon the
Killingworth Railway on the 25th July, 1814; and its powers were
tried on the same day.&nbsp; On an ascending gradient of 1 in
450, the engine succeeded in drawing after it eight loaded
carriages of thirty tons&rsquo; weight at about four miles an
hour; and for some time after it continued regularly at work.</p>
<p>Although a considerable advance upon previous locomotives,
&ldquo;Blutcher&rdquo; (as the engine was popularly called) was
nevertheless a somewhat cumbrous and clumsy machine.&nbsp; The
parts were huddled together.&nbsp; The boiler constituted the
principal feature; and being the foundation of the other parts,
it was made to do duty not only as a generator of steam, but also
as a basis for the fixings of the machinery and for the bearings
of the wheels and axles.&nbsp; The want of springs was seriously
felt; and the progress of the engine was a succession of jolts,
causing considerable derangement to the machinery.&nbsp; The mode
of communicating the motive power to the wheels by means of the
spur-gear also caused frequent jerks, each cylinder alternately
propelling or becoming propelled by the other, as the pressure of
the one upon the wheels became greater or less than the pressure
of the other; and when the teeth of the cogwheels became at all
worn, a rattling noise was produced during the travelling of the
engine.</p>
<p>As the principal test of the success of the locomotive was its
economy as compared with horse power, careful calculations were
made with the view of ascertaining this important point.&nbsp;
The result was, that it was found the working of the engine was
at first barely economical; and at the end of the year the steam
power and the horse power were ascertained to be as nearly as
possible upon a par in point of cost.&nbsp; The fate of the
locomotive in a great <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>measure depended on this very
engine.&nbsp; Its speed was not beyond that of a horse&rsquo;s
walk, and the heating surface presented to the fire being
comparatively small, sufficient steam could not be raised to
enable it to accomplish more on an average than about four miles
an hour.&nbsp; The result was anything but decisive; and the
locomotive might have been condemned as useless, had not our
engineer at this juncture applied the steam-blast, and by its
means carried his experiment to a triumphant issue.</p>
<p>The steam, after performing its duty in the cylinders, was at
first allowed to escape into the open atmosphere with a hissing
blast, to the terror of horses and cattle.&nbsp; It was
complained of as a nuisance; and an action at law against the
colliery lessees was threatened unless it was stopped.&nbsp;
Stephenson&rsquo;s attention had been drawn to the much greater
velocity with which the steam issued from the exit pipe compared
with that at which the smoke escaped from the chimney.&nbsp; He
conceived that, by conveying the eduction steam into the chimney,
by means of a small pipe, after it had performed its office in
the cylinders, allowing it to escape in a vertical direction, its
velocity would be imparted to the smoke from the fire, or to the
ascending current of air in the chimney, thereby increasing the
draft, and consequently the intensity of combustion in the
furnace.</p>
<p>The experiment was no sooner made than the power of the engine
was at once more than doubled; combustion was stimulated by the
blast; consequently the capability of the boiler to generate
steam was greatly increased, and the effective power of the
engine augmented in precisely the same proportion, without in any
way adding to its weight.&nbsp; This simple but beautiful
expedient was really fraught with the most important consequences
to railway communication; and it is not too much to say that the
success of the locomotive has in a great measure been the result
of its adoption.&nbsp; Without the steam-blast, by means of which
the intensity of combustion is maintained at its highest point,
producing a correspondingly rapid evolution of steam, high <!--
page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>rates of speed could not have been kept up; the
advantages of the multi-tubular boiler (afterwards invented)
could never have been fairly tested; and locomotives might still
have been dragging themselves unwieldily along at little more
than five or six miles an hour.</p>
<p>The steam-blast had scarcely been adopted, with so decided a
success, when Stephenson, observing the numerous defects in his
engine, and profiting by the experience which he had already
acquired, determined to construct a second engine, in which to
embody his improvements in their best form.&nbsp; Careful and
cautious observation of the working of his locomotive had
convinced him that the complication arising out of the action of
the two cylinders being combined by spur-wheels would prevent its
coming into practical use.&nbsp; He accordingly directed his
attention to an entire change in the construction and mechanical
arrangements of the machine; and in the following year,
conjointly with Mr. Dodds, who provided the necessary funds, he
took out a patent, dated the 28th of February, 1815, for an
engine which combined in a remarkable degree the essential
requisites of an economical locomotive; that is to say, few
parts, simplicity in their action, and directness in the mode by
which the power was communicated to the wheels supporting the
engine.</p>
<p>This locomotive, like the first, had two vertical cylinders,
which communicated <i>directly</i> with each pair of the four
wheels that supported the engine, by means of a cross head and a
pair of connecting rods.&nbsp; But in attempting to establish a
direct communication between the cylinders and the wheels that
rolled upon the rails, considerable difficulties presented
themselves.&nbsp; The ordinary joints could not be employed to
unite the parts of the engine, which was a rigid mass, with the
wheels lolling upon the irregular surface of the rails; for it
was evident that the two rails of the line of way&mdash;more
especially in those early days of imperfect construction of the
permanent road&mdash;could not always be maintained at the same
level,&mdash;that the wheel at <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>one end of
the axle might be depressed into one part of the line which had
subsided, whilst the other wheel would be comparatively elevated;
and in such a position of the axle and wheels, it was obvious
that a rigid communication between the cross head and the wheels
was impracticable.&nbsp; Hence it became necessary to form a
joint at the top of the piston-rod where it united with the cross
head, so as to permit the cross head to preserve complete
parallelism with the axle of the wheels with which it was in
communication.</p>
<p>In order to obtain that degree of flexibility combined with
direct action, which was essential for ensuring power and
avoiding needless friction and jars from irregularities in the
road, Stephenson made use of the &ldquo;ball and socket&rdquo;
joint for effecting a union between the ends of the cross heads
where they united with the connecting rods, and between the ends
of the connecting rods where they were united with the crank-pins
attached to each driving-wheel.&nbsp; By this arrangement the
parallelism between the cross head and the axle was at all times
maintained and preserved, without producing any serious jar or
friction on any part of the machine.&nbsp; Another important
point was, to combine each pair of wheels by means of some simple
mechanism instead of by the cogwheels which had formerly been
used.&nbsp; And, with this object, Stephenson made cranks in each
axle at right angles to each other, with rods communicating
horizontally between them.</p>
<p>A locomotive was constructed upon this plan in 1815, and was
found to answer extremely well.&nbsp; But at that period the
mechanical skill of the country was not equal to forging cranked
axles of the soundness and strength necessary to stand the jars
incident to locomotive work.&nbsp; Stephenson was accordingly
compelled to fall back upon a substitute, which, although less
simple and efficient, was within the mechanical capabilities of
the workmen of that day, in respect of construction as well as
repair.&nbsp; He adopted a chain which rolled over indented
wheels placed on the <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>centre of each axle, and was so
arranged that the two pairs of wheels were effectually coupled
and made to keep pace with each other.&nbsp; The chain, however,
after a few years&rsquo; use, became stretched; and then the
engines were liable to irregularity in their working, especially
in changing from working back to working forward again.&nbsp;
Eventually the chain was laid aside, and the front and hind
wheels were united by rods on the outside, instead of by rods and
crank axles inside, as specified in the original patent.&nbsp;
This expedient completely answered the purpose required, without
involving any expensive or difficult workmanship.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1815, by dint of patient and persevering
labour,&mdash;by careful observation of the works of others, and
never neglecting to avail himself of their
suggestions,&mdash;Stephenson succeeded in manufacturing an
engine which included the following important improvements on all
previous attempts in the same direction:&mdash;viz., simple and
direct communication between the cylinders and the wheels rolling
upon the rails; joint adhesion of all the wheels, attained by the
use of horizontal connecting-rods; and finally, a beautiful
method of exciting the combustion of the fuel by employing the
waste steam, which had formerly been allowed to escape uselessly
into the air.&nbsp; Although many improvements in detail were
afterwards introduced in the locomotive by George Stephenson
himself, as well as by his equally distinguished son, it is
perhaps not too much to say that this engine, as a mechanical
contrivance, contained the germ of all that has since been
effected.&nbsp; It may in fact be regarded as the type of the
present locomotive engine.</p>

<p>Explosions of fire-damp were unusually frequent in the coal
mines of Northumberland and Durham about the time when George
Stephenson was engaged in the construction of his first
locomotives.&nbsp; These explosions were often attended with
fearful loss of life and dreadful suffering to the
workpeople.&nbsp; Killingworth Colliery was not free from such
deplorable calamities; and during the time that Stephenson was
employed as a brakesman at the West Moor, several
&ldquo;blasts&rdquo; took place in the pit, by which many workmen
were scorched and killed, and the owners of the colliery
sustained heavy losses.&nbsp; One of the most serious of these
accidents occurred in 1806, not long after he had been appointed
brakesman, by which 10 persons were killed.&nbsp; Stephenson was
working at the mouth of the pit at the time, and the
circumstances connected with the accident made a deep impression
on his mind.</p>
<p>Another explosion took place in the same pit in 1809, by which
12 persons lost their lives.&nbsp; The blast did not reach the
shaft as in the former case; the unfortunate persons in the pit
having been suffocated by the after-damp.&nbsp; More calamitous
still were the explosions which took place in the neighbouring
collieries; one of the worst being that of 1812, in the Felling
Pit, near Gateshead, by which no fewer than 90 men and boys were
suffocated or burnt to death.&nbsp; And a similar accident
occurred in the same pit in the year following, by which 22
persons perished.</p>
<p>It was natural that George Stephenson should devote his
attention to the causes of these deplorable accidents, and to the
means by which they might if possible be prevented.&nbsp; <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>His daily occupation led him to think much and deeply on
the subject.&nbsp; As engine-wright of a colliery so extensive as
that of Killingworth, where there were nearly 160 miles of
gallery excavation, in which he personally superintended the
working of the inclined planes along which the coals were sent to
the pit entrance, he was necessarily very often underground, and
brought face to face with the dangers of fire-damp.&nbsp; From
fissures in the roofs of the galleries, carburetted hydrogen gas
was constantly flowing; in some of the more dangerous places it
might be heard escaping from the crevices of the coal with a
hissing noise.&nbsp; Ventilation, firing, and all conceivable
modes of drawing out the foul air had been adopted, and the more
dangerous parts of the galleries were built up.&nbsp; Still the
danger could not be wholly prevented.&nbsp; The miners must
necessarily guide their steps through the extensive underground
ways with lighted lamps or candles, the naked flame of which,
coming in contact with the inflammable air, daily exposed them
and their fellow-workers in the pit to the risk of death in one
of its most dreadful forms.</p>
<p>One day, in 1814, a workman hurried into Stephenson&rsquo;s
cottage with the startling information that the deepest main of
the colliery was on fire!&nbsp; He immediately hastened to the
pit-head, about a hundred yards off, whither the women and
children of the colliery were running, with wildness and terror
depicted in every face.&nbsp; In a commanding voice Stephenson
ordered the engineman to lower him down the shaft in the
corve.&nbsp; There was peril, it might be death, before him, but
he must go.</p>
<p>He was soon at the bottom, and in the midst of the men, who
were paralysed by the danger which threatened the lives of all in
the pit.&nbsp; Leaping from the corve on its touching the ground,
he called out; &ldquo;Are there six men among you who have
courage to follow me?&nbsp; If so, come, and we will put the fire
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Killingworth pitmen had the most perfect
confidence in their engine-wright, and they readily volunteered
to follow him.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Silence succeeded the frantic tumult of the previous minute,
and the men set to work with a will.&nbsp; In every mine, bricks,
mortar, and tools enough are at hand, and by Stephenson&rsquo;s
direction the materials were forthwith carried to the required
spot, where, in a very short time a wall was raised at the
entrance to the main, he himself taking the most active part in
the work.&nbsp; The atmospheric air was by this means excluded,
the fire was extinguished, the people were saved from death, and
the mine was preserved.</p>
<p>This anecdote of Stephenson was related to the writer, near
the pit-mouth, by one of the men who had been present and helped
to build up the brick wall by which the fire was stayed, though
several workmen were suffocated.&nbsp; He related that, when down
the pit some days after, seeking out the dead bodies, the cause
of the accident was the subject of conversation, and Stephenson
was asked, &ldquo;Can nothing be done to prevent such awful
occurrences?&rdquo;&nbsp; His reply was that he thought something
might be done.&nbsp; <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;the sooner you start the better; for the price of
coal-mining now is <i>pitmen&rsquo;s lives</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifty years since, many of the best pits were so full of the
inflammable gas given forth by the coal, that they could not be
worked without the greatest danger; and for this reason some were
altogether abandoned, The rudest possible methods were adopted of
producing light sufficient to enable the pitmen to work by.&nbsp;
The phosphorescence of decayed fish-skins was tried; but this,
though safe, was very inefficient.&nbsp; The most common method
employed was what was called a steel mill, the notched wheel of
which, being made to revolve against a flint, struck a succession
of sparks, which scarcely served to do more than make the
darkness visible.&nbsp; A boy carried the apparatus after the
miner, working the wheel, and by the imperfect light thus given
forth he plied his dangerous trade.&nbsp; Candles were only used
in those parts of the pit where gas was not abundant.&nbsp; Under
this rude system not more than one-third of the coal could be
worked; and two-thirds were left.</p>
<p>What the workmen, not less than the coal-owners, eagerly
desired was, a lamp that should give forth sufficient light,
without communicating flame to the inflammable gas which
accumulated in certain parts of the pit.&nbsp; Something had
already been attempted towards the invention of such a lamp by
Dr. Clanny, of Sunderland, who, in 1813, contrived an apparatus
to which he gave air from the mine through water, by means of
bellows.&nbsp; This lamp went out of itself in inflammable
gas.&nbsp; It was found, however, too unwieldy to be used by the
miners for the purposes of their work, and did not come into
general use.&nbsp; A committee of gentlemen was formed to
investigate the causes of the explosions, and to devise, if
possible, some means of preventing them.&nbsp; At the invitation
of that Committee, Sir Humphry Davy, then in the full zenith of
his reputation, was requested to turn his attention to the
subject.&nbsp; He accordingly visited the collieries near
Newcastle on the 24th of August, 1815; and on the 9th of November
following, he read before the Royal <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Society of
London his celebrated paper &ldquo;On the Fire-Damp of Coal
Mines, and on Methods of lighting the Mine so as to prevent its
explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a humbler though not less diligent and original thinker
had been at work before him, and had already practically solved
the problem of the Safety-Lamp.&nbsp; Stephenson was of course
well aware of the anxiety which prevailed in the colliery
districts as to the invention of a lamp which should give light
enough for the miners to work by without exploding the
fire-damp.&nbsp; The painful incidents above described only
served to quicken his eagerness to master the difficulty.</p>
<p>For several years he had been engaged, in his own rude way, in
making experiments with the fire-damp in the Killingworth
mine.&nbsp; The pitmen used to expostulate with him on these
occasions, believing his experiments to be fraught with
danger.&nbsp; One of the sinkers, observing him holding up
lighted candles to the windward of the &ldquo;blower&rdquo; or
fissure from which the inflammable gas escaped, entreated him to
desist; but Stephenson&rsquo;s answer was, that &ldquo;he was
busy with a plan by which he hoped to make his experiments useful
for preserving men&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; On these occasions
the miners usually got out of the way before he lit the gas.</p>
<p>In 1815, although he was very much occupied with the business
of the collieries and the improvement of his locomotive engine,
he was also busily engaged in making experiments upon inflammable
gas in the Killingworth pit.&nbsp; According to the explanation
afterwards given by him, he imagined that if he could construct a
lamp with a chimney so arranged as to cause a strong current, it
would not fire at the top of the chimney; as the burnt air would
ascend with such a velocity as to prevent the inflammable air of
the pit from descending towards the flame; and such a lamp, he
thought, might be taken into a dangerous atmosphere without risk
of exploding.</p>
<p>Such was Stephenson&rsquo;s theory when he proceeded to <!--
page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>embody his idea of a miner&rsquo;s safety-lamp in a
practical form.&nbsp; In the month of August, 1815, he requested
his friend Nicholas Wood, the head viewer, to prepare a drawing
of a lamp according to the description which he gave him.&nbsp;
After several evenings&rsquo; careful deliberations, the drawing
was made, and shown to several of the head men about the
works.</p>
<p>Stephenson proceeded to order a lamp to be made by a Newcastle
tinman, according to his plan; and at the same time he directed a
glass to be made for the lamp at the Northumberland Glass
House.&nbsp; Both were received by him from the makers on the
21st October, and the lamp was taken to Killingworth for the
purpose of immediate experiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that evening as distinctly as if it had been
but yesterday,&rdquo; said Robert Stephenson, describing the
circumstances to the author in 1857: &ldquo;Moodie came to our
cottage about dusk, and asked, &lsquo;if father had got back yet
with the lamp?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
I&rsquo;ll wait till he comes,&rsquo; said Moodie, &lsquo;he
can&rsquo;t be long now.&rsquo;&nbsp; In about half-an-hour, in
came my father, his face all radiant.&nbsp; He had the lamp with
him!&nbsp; It was at once uncovered, and shown to Moodie.&nbsp;
Then it was filled with oil, trimmed, and lighted.&nbsp; All was
ready, only the head viewer hadn&rsquo;t arrived.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Run over to Benton for Nichol, Robert,&rsquo; said my
father to me, &lsquo;and ask him to come directly; say
we&rsquo;re going down the pit to try the lamp.&rsquo;&nbsp; By
this time it was quite dark; and off I ran to bring Nicholas
Wood.&nbsp; His house was at Benton, about a mile off.&nbsp;
There was a short cut through the Churchyard, but just as I was
about to pass the wicket, I saw what I thought was a white figure
moving about amongst the grave-stones.&nbsp; I took it for a
ghost!&nbsp; My heart fluttered, and I was in a great fright, but
to Wood&rsquo;s house I must get, so I made the circuit of the
Churchyard; and when I got round to the other side I looked, and
lo! the figure was still there.&nbsp; But what do you think it
was?&nbsp; Only the grave-digger, plying his work at that late
hour by <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the light of his lanthorn set upon
one of the gravestones!&nbsp; I found Wood at home, and in a few
minutes he was mounted and off to my father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When I
got back, I was told they had just left&mdash;it was then about
eleven&mdash;and gone down the shaft to try the lamp in one of
the most dangerous parts of the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the bottom of the shaft with the lamp, the party
directed their steps towards one of the foulest galleries in the
pit, where the explosive gas was issuing through a blower in the
roof of the mine with a loud hissing noise.&nbsp; By erecting
some deal boarding round that part of the gallery into which the
gas was escaping, the air was made more foul for the purpose of
the experiment.&nbsp; After waiting about an hour, Moodie, whose
practical experience of fire-damp in pits was greater than that
of either Stephenson or Wood, was requested to go into the place
which had thus been made foul; and, having done so, he returned,
and told them that the smell of the air was such, that if a
lighted candle were now introduced, an explosion must inevitably
take place.&nbsp; He cautioned Stephenson as to the danger both
to themselves and to the pit, if the gas took fire.&nbsp; But
Stephenson declared his confidence in the safety of his lamp,
and, having lit the wick, he boldly proceeded with it towards the
explosive air.&nbsp; The others, more timid and doubtful, hung
back when they came within hearing of the blower; and
apprehensive of the danger, they retired into a safe place, out
of sight of the lamp, which gradually disappeared with its bearer
in the recesses of the mine. <a name="citation95"></a><a
href="#footnote95" class="citation">[95]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Advancing to the place of danger, and entering within
the fouled air, his lighted lamp in hand, Stephenson held it
finally out, in the full current of the blower, and within a few
inches of its mouth.&nbsp; Thus exposed, the flame of the lamp at
first increased, then flickered, and then went out; but there was
no explosion of the gas.&nbsp; Returning to his companions, who
were still at a distance, he told them what had occurred.&nbsp;
Having now acquired somewhat more confidence, they advanced with
him to a point from which they could observe him repeat his
experiment, but still at a safe distance.&nbsp; They saw that
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>when the lighted lamp was held within the explosive
mixture, there was a great flame; the lamp became almost full of
fire; and then it smothered out.&nbsp; Again returning to his
companions, he relighted the lamp, and repeated the experiment
several times with the same result.&nbsp; At length Wood and
Moodie ventured to advance close to the fouled part of the pit;
and, in making some of the later trials, Mr. Wood himself held up
the lighted lamp to the blower.</p>
<p>Before leaving the pit, Stephenson expressed his opinion that
by an alteration of the lamp which he then contemplated, he could
make it burn better; this was by a change in the slide through
which the air was admitted into the lower part, under the
flame.&nbsp; After making some experiments on the air collected
at the blower, by bladders which were mounted with tubes of
various diameters, he satisfied himself that, when the tube was
reduced to a certain diameter, the foul air would not pass
through; and he fashioned his slide accordingly, reducing the
diameter of the tube until he conceived it was quite safe.&nbsp;
In about a fortnight the experiments were repeated, in a place
purposely made foul as before; on this occasion a larger number
of persons ventured to witness them, and they again proved
successful.&nbsp; The lamp was not yet, however, so efficient as
the inventor desired.&nbsp; It required, he observed, to be kept
very steady when burning in the inflammable gas, otherwise it was
liable to go out, in consequence, as he imagined, of the contact
of the burnt air (as he then called it), or azotic gas, which
lodged round the exterior of the flame.&nbsp; If the lamp was
moved horizontally, the azote came in contact with the flame and
extinguished it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It struck me,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that if I put more tubes in, I should discharge the
poisonous matter that hung round the flame, by admitting the air
to its exterior part.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although he had then no access
to scientific books, nor intercourse with scientific men, nor
anything that could assist him in his investigation, besides his
own indefatigable spirit of inquiry, he contrived a rude
apparatus by which he tested the explosive properties of the gas
and <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>the velocity of current (for this was the direction of
his inquiries) necessary to enable the explosive gas to pass
through tubes of different diameters.&nbsp; In making these
experiments in his humble cottage at the West Moor, Nicholas Wood
and George&rsquo;s son Robert usually acted as his assistants,
and sometimes the gentlemen of the neighbourhood interested in
coal-mining attended as spectators.</p>
<p>These experiments were not performed without risk, for on one
occasion the experimenting party had nearly blown off the roof of
the cottage.&nbsp; One of these &ldquo;blows up&rdquo; was
described by Stephenson himself before the Committee on Accidents
in Coal Mines, in 1835: &ldquo;I made several experiments,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;as to the velocity required in tubes of different
diameters, to prevent explosion from fire-damp.&nbsp; We made the
mixtures in all proportions of light carburetted hydrogen with
atmospheric air in the receiver, and we found by the experiments
that when a current of the most explosive mixture that we could
make was forced up a tube 4/10 of an inch in diameter, the
necessary current was 9 inches in a second to prevent its coming
down that tube.&nbsp; These experiments were repeated several
times.&nbsp; We had two or three blows up in making the
experiments, by the flame getting down into the receiver, though
we had a piece of very fine wire-gauze put at the bottom of the
pipe, between the receiver and the pipe through which we were
forcing the current.&nbsp; In one of these experiments I was
watching the flame in the tube, my son was taking the vibrations
of the pendulum of the clock, and Mr. Wood was attending to give
me the column of water as I called for it, to keep the current up
to a certain point.&nbsp; As I saw the flame descending in the
tube I called for more water, and Wood unfortunately turned the
cock the wrong way, the current ceased, the flame went down the
tube, and all our implements were blown to pieces, which at the
time we were not very able to replace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephenson followed up those experiments by others of a
similar kind, with the view of ascertaining whether <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>ordinary flame would pass through tubes of a small
diameter and with this object he filed off the barrels of several
small keys.&nbsp; Placing these together, he held them
perpendicularly over a strong flame, and ascertained that it did
not pass upward.&nbsp; This was a further proof to him of the
soundness of the course he was pursuing.</p>
<p>In order to correct the defect of his first lamp he resolved
to alter it so as to admit the air to the flame by several tubes
of reduced diameter, instead of by a single tube.&nbsp; He
inferred that a sufficient quantity of air would thus be
introduced into the lamp for the purposes of combustion, while
the smallness of the apertures would still prevent the explosive
gas passing downwards, at the same time that the &ldquo;burnt
air&rdquo; (the cause, in his opinion, of the lamp going out)
would be more effectually dislodged.&nbsp; He accordingly took
the lamp to a tinman in Newcastle, and had it altered so that the
air was admitted by three small tubes inserted in the bottom of
the lamp, the openings of which were placed on the outside of the
burner, instead of having (as in the original lamp) the one tube
opening directly under the flame.</p>
<p>This second or altered lamp was tried in the Killingworth pit
on the 4th November, and was found to burn better than the first,
and to be perfectly safe.&nbsp; But as it did not yet come quite
up to the inventor&rsquo;s expectations, he proceeded to contrive
a third lamp, in which he proposed to surround the oil vessel
with a number of capillary tubes.&nbsp; Then it struck him, that
if he cut off the middle of the tubes, or made holes in metal
plates, placed at a distance from each other, equal to the length
of the tubes, the air would get in better, and the effect in
preventing explosion would be the same.</p>
<p>He was encouraged to persevere in the completion of his
safety-lamp by the occurrence of several fatal accidents about
this time in the Killingworth pit.&nbsp; On the 9th November a
boy was killed by a blast in the <i>A</i> pit, at the very place
where Stephenson had made the experiments <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>with his
first lamp; and, when told of the accident, he observed that if
the boy had been provided with his lamp, his life would have been
saved.&nbsp; On the 20th November he went over to Newcastle to
order his third lamp from a plumber in that town.&nbsp; The
plumber referred him to his clerk, whom Stephenson invited to
join him at a neighbouring public-house, where they might quietly
talk over the matter, and finally settle the plan of the new
lamp.&nbsp; They adjourned to the &ldquo;Newcastle Arms,&rdquo;
near the present High Level Bridge, where they had some ale, and
a design of the lamp was drawn in pencil upon a half-sheet of
foolscap, with a rough specification subjoined.&nbsp; The sketch,
when shown to us by Robert Stephenson some years since, still
bore the marks of the ale.&nbsp; It was a very rude design, but
sufficient to work from.&nbsp; It was immediately placed in the
hands of the workmen, finished in the course of a few days, and
experimentally tested in the Killingworth pit like the previous
lamps, on the 30th November.&nbsp; At that time neither
Stephenson nor Wood had heard of Sir Humphry Davy&rsquo;s
experiments nor of the lamp which that gentleman proposed to
construct.</p>
<p>An angry controversy afterwards took place as to the
respective merits of George Stephenson and Sir Humphry Davy in
respect of the invention of the safety-lamp.&nbsp; A committee
was formed on both sides, and the facts were stated in various
ways.&nbsp; It is perfectly clear, however, that Stephenson had
ascertained <i>the fact</i> that flame will not pass through
tubes of a certain diameter&mdash;the principle on which the
safety-lamp is constructed&mdash;before Sir Humphry Davy had
formed any definite idea on the subject, or invented the model
lamp afterwards exhibited by him before the Royal Society.&nbsp;
Stephenson had actually constructed a lamp on such a principle,
and proved its safety, before Sir Humphry had communicated his
views on the subject to any person; and by the time that the
first public intimation had been given of his discovery,
Stephenson&rsquo;s second lamp had been constructed and tested in
like manner in the <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Killingworth pit.&nbsp; The
<i>first</i> was tried on the 21st October, 1815; the
<i>second</i> was tried on the 4th November; but it was not until
the 9th November that Sir Humphry Davy presented his first lamp
to the public.&nbsp; And by the 30th of the same month, as we
have seen, Stephenson had constructed and tested his <i>third</i>
safety-lamp.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s theory of the &ldquo;burnt air&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;draught&rdquo; was no doubt wrong; but his lamp was
right, and that was the great fact which mainly concerned
him.&nbsp; Torricelli did not know the rationale of his tube, nor
Otto G&uuml;rike that of his air-pump; yet no one thinks of
denying them the merit of their inventions on that account.&nbsp;
The discoveries of Volta and Galvani were in like manner
independent of theory; the greatest discoveries consisting in
bringing to light certain grand facts, on which theories are
afterwards framed.&nbsp; Our inventor had been pursuing the
Baconian <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>method, though he did not think of
that, but of inventing a safe lamp, which he knew could only be
done through the process of repeated experiment.&nbsp; He
experimented upon the fire-damp at the blowers in the mine, and
also by means of the apparatus which was blown up in his cottage,
as above described by himself.&nbsp; By experiment he distinctly
ascertained that the explosion of fire-damp could not pass
through small tubes; and he also did what had not before been
done by any inventor&mdash;he constructed a lamp on this
principle, and repeatedly proved its safety at the risk of his
life.&nbsp; At the same time, there is no doubt that it was to
Sir Humphry Davy that the merit belonged of having pointed out
the true law on which the safety-lamp is constructed.</p>
<p>The subject of this important invention excited so much
interest in the northern mining districts, and Stephenson&rsquo;s
numerous friends considered his lamp so completely
successful&mdash;having stood the test of repeated
experiments&mdash;that they urged him to bring his invention
before the Philosophical and Literary Society of Newcastle, of
whose apparatus he had availed himself in the course of his
experiments on fire-damp.&nbsp; After much persuasion he
consented, and a meeting was appointed for the purpose of
receiving his explanations, on the evening of the 5th December,
1815.&nbsp; Stephenson was at that time so diffident in manner
and unpractised in speech, that he took with him his friend
Nicholas Wood, to act as his interpreter and expositor on the
occasion.&nbsp; From eighty to a hundred of the most intelligent
members of the society were present at the meeting, when Mr. Wood
stood forward to expound the principles on which the lamp had
been formed, and to describe the details of its
construction.&nbsp; Several questions were put, to which Mr. Wood
proceeded to give replies to the best of his knowledge.&nbsp; But
Stephenson, who up to that time had stood behind Wood, screened
from notice, observing that the explanations given were not quite
correct, could no longer control his reserve, and, standing
forward, he proceeded in his strong Northumbrian dialect, to
describe the lamp, down to its <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>minutest
details.&nbsp; He then produced several bladders full of
carburetted hydrogen, which he had collected from the blowers in
the Killingworth mine, and proved the safety of his lamp by
numerous experiments with the gas, repeated in various ways; his
earnest and impressive manner exciting in the minds of his
auditors the liveliest interest both in the inventor and his
invention.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Sir H. Davy&rsquo;s model lamp was received and
exhibited to the coal-miners at Newcastle, on which occasion the
observation was made by several gentlemen, &ldquo;Why, it is the
same as Stephenson&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Stephenson&rsquo;s claim to be regarded as the
first inventor of the Tube Safety-lamp, his merits do not seem to
have been generally recognised; and Sir Humphry Davy carried off
the larger share of the <i>&eacute;clat</i> which attached to the
discovery.&nbsp; What chance had the unknown workman of
Killingworth with so distinguished a competitor?&nbsp; The one
was as yet but a colliery engine-wright, scarce raised above the
manual-labour class, pursuing his experiments in obscurity, with
a view only to usefulness; the other was the scientific prodigy
of his day, the most brilliant of lecturers, and the most popular
of philosophers.</p>
<p>No small indignation was expressed by the friends of Sir
Humphry Davy at Stephenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;presumption&rdquo; in
laying claim to the invention of the safety-lamp.&nbsp; In 1831
Dr. Paris, in his &lsquo;Life of Sir Humphry Davy,&rsquo; thus
wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;It will hereafter be scarcely believed that
an invention so eminently scientific, and which could never have
been derived but from the sterling treasury of science, should
have been claimed on behalf of an engine-wright of Killingworth,
of the name of Stephenson&mdash;a person not even possessing a
knowledge of the elements of chemistry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stephenson was far above claiming for himself any
invention not his own.&nbsp; He had already accomplished a far
greater feat than the making of a safety-lamp&mdash;he had
constructed a successful locomotive, which was to be seen in
daily work on the Killingworth railway.&nbsp; By the <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>improvements he had made in the engine, he might almost
be said to have <i>invented</i> it; but no one&mdash;not even the
philosophers&mdash;detected the significance of that wonderful
machine.&nbsp; What railways were to become, rested in a great
measure with that &ldquo;engine-wright of Killingworth, of the
name of Stephenson,&rdquo; though he was scarcely known as yet
beyond the bounds of his own district.</p>
<p>As to the value of the invention of the safety-lamp there
could be no doubt; and the colliery owners of Durham and
Northumberland, to testify their sense of its importance,
determined to present a testimonial to its inventor.&nbsp; The
friends of Sir H. Davy met in August, 1816, to take steps for
raising a subscription for the purpose.&nbsp; The advertised
object of the meeting was to present him with a reward for
&ldquo;the invention of <i>his</i> safety-lamp.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this no objection could be taken; for though the principle on
which the safety-lamps of Stephenson and Davy were constructed
was the same; and although Stephenson&rsquo;s lamp was,
unquestionably, the first successful lamp that had been
constructed on such principle, and proved to be
efficient,&mdash;yet Sir H. Davy did invent a safety-lamp, no
doubt quite independent of all that Stephenson had done; and
having directed his careful attention to the subject, and
elucidated the true theory of explosion of carburetted hydrogen,
he was entitled to all praise and reward for his labours.&nbsp;
But when the meeting of coal-owners proposed to raise a
subscription for the purpose of presenting Sir H. Davy with a
reward for &ldquo;his invention of <i>the</i> safety-lamp,&rdquo;
the case was entirely altered; and Stephenson&rsquo;s friends
then proceeded to assert his claims to be regarded as its first
inventor.</p>
<p>Many meetings took place on the subject, and much discussion
ensued, the result of which was that a sum of &pound;2000 was
presented to Sir Humphry Davy as &ldquo;the inventor of the
safety-lamp;&rdquo; but, at the same time, a purse of 100 guineas
was voted to George Stephenson, in consideration of what he had
done in the same direction.&nbsp; This result was, however very
unsatisfactory to Stephenson, as well as to his friends, <!--
page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>and Mr. Brandling, of Gosforth, suggested to him that,
the subject being now fairly before the public, he should publish
a statement of the facts on which his claim was founded.</p>
<p>This was not at all in George&rsquo;s line.&nbsp; He had never
appeared in print; and it seemed to him a more formidable thing
to write a letter for &ldquo;the papers&rdquo; than to invent a
safety-lamp or design a locomotive.&nbsp; However, he called to
his aid his son Robert, set him down before a sheet of foolscap,
and told him to &ldquo;put down there just what I tell
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The composition of this letter, as we were
informed by the writer of it, occupied more evenings than one;
and when it was at length finished, after many corrections, and
fairly copied out, the father and son set out&mdash;the latter
dressed in his Sunday&rsquo;s round jacket&mdash;to lay the joint
production before Mr. Brandling, at Gosforth House.&nbsp;
Glancing over the letter, Mr. Brandling said, &ldquo;George, this
will never do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all true, sir,&rdquo;
was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;That may be; but it is badly
written.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert blushed, for he thought the
penmanship was called in question, and he had written his
best.&nbsp; Mr. Brandling, however, revised the letter, which was
shortly after published in the local journals.</p>
<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s friends, fully satisfied of his claims to
priority as the inventor of the safety-lamp used in the
Killingworth and other collieries, held a public meeting for the
purpose of presenting him with a reward &ldquo;for the valuable
service he had thus rendered to mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
subscription was immediately commenced with this object, and a
committee was formed, consisting of the Earl of Strathmore, C. J.
Brandling, and others.&nbsp; The subscriptions, when collected,
amounted to &pound;1000.&nbsp; Part of the money was devoted to
the purchase of a silver tankard, which was presented to the
inventor, together with the balance of the subscription, at a
public dinner given in the Assembly Rooms at Newcastle. <a
name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a>&nbsp; But what gave Stephenson even
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>greater pleasure than the silver tankard and purse of
sovereigns was the gift of a silver watch, purchased by small
subscriptions amongst the colliers themselves, and presented by
them as a token of their personal esteem and regard for him, as
well as of their gratitude for the perseverance and skill with
which he had prosecuted his valuable and lifesaving invention to
a successful issue.</p>
<p>However great the merits of Stephenson in connexion with the
invention of the tube safety-lamp, they cannot be regarded as
detracting from the reputation of Sir Humphry Davy.&nbsp; His
inquiries into the explosive properties of carburetted hydrogen
gas were quite original; and his discovery of the fact that
explosion will not pass through tubes of a certain diameter was
made independently of all that Stephenson had done in
verification of the same fact.&nbsp; It even appears that Mr.
Smithson Tennant and Dr. Wollaston had observed the same fact
several years before, though neither Stephenson nor Davy knew it
while they were prosecuting their experiments.&nbsp; Sir Humphry
Davy&rsquo;s subsequent modification of the tube-lamp, by which,
while diminishing the diameter, he in the same ratio shortened
the tubes without danger, and in the form of wire-gauze enveloped
the safety-lamp by a multiplicity of tubes, was a beautiful
application of the true theory which he had formed upon the
subject.</p>
<p>The increased number of accidents which have occurred from
explosions in coal-mines since the general introduction of the
Davy lamp, have led to considerable doubts as to its safety, and
to inquiries as to the means by which it may be further improved;
for experience has shown that, under certain circumstances, the
Davy lamp is <i>not</i> safe.&nbsp; <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Stephenson
was himself of opinion that the modification of his own and Sir
Humphry Davy&rsquo;s lamp, combining the glass cylinder with the
wire-gauze, was the most secure; at the same time it must be
admitted that the Davy and the Geordy lamps alike failed to stand
the severe tests to which they were submitted by Dr. Pereira,
before the Committee on Accidents in Mines.&nbsp; Indeed, Dr.
Pereira did not hesitate to say, that when exposed to a current
of explosive gas the Davy lamp is &ldquo;decidedly unsafe,&rdquo;
and that the experiments by which its safety had been
&ldquo;demonstrated&rdquo; in the lecture-room had proved
entirely &ldquo;fallacious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that under circumstances in which the
wire-gauze of the Davy lamp becomes red-hot from the high
explosiveness of the gas, the Geordy lamp is extinguished; and we
cannot but think that this fact testifies to the decidedly
superior safety of the Geordy.&nbsp; An accident occurred in the
Oaks colliery Pit at Barnsley, on the 20th August, 1857, which
strikingly exemplified the respective qualities of the
lamps.&nbsp; A sudden outburst of gas took place from the floor
of the mine, along a distance of fifty yards.&nbsp; Fortunately
the men working in the pit at the time were all supplied with
safety-lamps&mdash;the hewers with Stephenson&rsquo;s, and the
hurriers with Davy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Upon this occasion, the whole
of the Stephenson&rsquo;s lamps, over a space of five hundred
yards, were extinguished almost instantaneously; whereas the Davy
lamps were filled with fire, and became red-hot&mdash;so much so,
that several of the men using them had their hands burnt by the
gauze.&nbsp; Had a strong current of air been blowing through the
gallery at the time, an explosion would most probably have taken
place&mdash;an accident which, it will be observed, could not,
under such circumstances, occur from the use of the Geordy, which
is immediately extinguished as soon as the air becomes explosive.

Improvements in the Locomotive</span>&mdash;<span

class="smcap">Robert Stephenson as Viewer&rsquo;s Apprentice and
Student</span>.</h2>
<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s experiments on fire-damp, and his labours
in connexion with the invention of the safety-lamp, occupied but
a small portion of his time, which was necessarily devoted for
the most part to the ordinary business of the colliery.&nbsp;
From the day of his appointment as engine-wright, one of the
subjects which particularly occupied his attention was the best
practical method of winning and raising the coal.&nbsp; He was
one of the first to introduce steam machinery underground with
the latter object.&nbsp; Indeed, the Killingworth mines came to
be regarded as the models of the district; the working
arrangements generally being conducted in a skilful and efficient
manner, reflecting the highest credit on the colliery
engineer.</p>
<p>Besides attending to the underground arrangements, the
improved transit of the coals above-ground from the pithead to
the shipping-place, demanded an increasing share of his
attention.&nbsp; Every day&rsquo;s experience convinced him that
the locomotive constructed by him after his patent of the year
1815, was far from perfect; though he continued to entertain
confident hopes of its eventual success.&nbsp; He even went so
far as to say that the locomotive would yet supersede every other
traction-power for drawing heavy loads.&nbsp; Many still regarded
his travelling engine as little better than a curious toy; and
some, shaking their heads, predicted for it &ldquo;a terrible
blow-up some day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was daily
performing its work with regularity, dragging the coal-waggons
between the colliery and the staiths, and <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>saving the
labour of many men and horses.&nbsp; There was not, however, so
marked a saving in haulage as to induce the colliery masters to
adopt locomotive power generally as a substitute for
horses.&nbsp; How it could be improved and rendered more
efficient as well as economical, was constantly present to
Stephenson&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>At an early period of his labours, or about the time when he
had completed his second locomotive, he began to direct his
particular attention to the state of the Road; as he perceived
that the extended use of the locomotive must necessarily depend
in a great measure upon the perfection, solidity, continuity, and
smoothness of the way along which the engine travelled.&nbsp;
Even at that early period, he was in the habit of regarding the
road and the locomotive as one machine, speaking of the rail and
the wheel as &ldquo;man and wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All railways were at that time laid in a careless and loose
manner, and great inequalities of level were allowed to occur
without much attention being paid to repairs.&nbsp; The
consequence was a great loss of power, as well as much tear and
wear of the machinery, by the frequent jolts and blows of the
wheels against the rails.&nbsp; His first object therefore was,
to remove the inequalities produced by the imperfect junction
between rail and rail.&nbsp; At that time, (in 1816) the rails
were made of cast iron, each rail being about three feet long;
and sufficient care was not taken to maintain the points of
junction on the same level.&nbsp; The chairs, or cast-iron
pedestals into which the rails were inserted, were flat at the
bottom; so that, whenever any disturbance took place in the stone
blocks or sleepers supporting them, the flat base of the chair
upon which the rails rested being tilted by unequal subsidence,
the end of one rail became depressed, whilst that of the other
was elevated.&nbsp; Hence constant jolts and shocks, the reaction
of which very often caused the fracture of the rails, and
occasionally threw the engine off the road.</p>
<p>To remedy this imperfection Mr. Stephenson devised a <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>new chair, with an entirely new mode of fixing the
rails therein.&nbsp; Instead of adopting the <i>butt-joint</i>
which had hitherto been used in all cast-iron rails, he adopted
the <i>half-lap joint</i>, by which means the rails extended a
certain distance over each other at the ends, like a
scarf-joint.&nbsp; These ends, instead of resting upon the flat
chair, were made to rest upon the apex of a curve forming the
bottom of the chair.&nbsp; The supports were also extended from
three feet to three feet nine inches or four feet apart.&nbsp;
These rails were accordingly substituted for the old cast-iron
plates on the Killingworth Colliery Railway, and they were found
to be a very great improvement upon the previous system, adding
both to the efficiency of the horse-power, still employed in
working the railway, and to the smooth action of the locomotive
engine, but more particularly increasing the efficiency of the
latter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p111.jpg">
<img alt=
"Half-lap Joint"
title=
"Half-lap Joint"
src="images/p111.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This improved form of rail and chair was embodied in a patent
taken out in the joint names of Mr. Losh, of Newcastle,
iron-founder, and of Mr. Stephenson, bearing date 30th September,
1816.&nbsp; Mr. Losh being a wealthy, enterprising
iron-manufacturer, and having confidence in George Stephenson and
his improvements, found the money for the purpose of taking out
the patent, which, in those days, was a very costly as well as
troublesome affair.</p>
<p>The specification of the same patent also described various
important improvements in the locomotive itself.&nbsp; The wheels
of the engine were improved, being altered from cast to malleable
iron, in whole or in part, by which they were made lighter as
well as more durable and safe.&nbsp; But the most ingenious and
original contrivance embodied in this patent was the substitute
for springs which Mr. Stephenson invented.&nbsp; He contrived
that the steam generated <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>in the
boiler should perform this important office.&nbsp; The method by
which this was effected displayed such genuine mechanical genius,
that we would particularly call attention to the device, which
was the more remarkable, as it was contrived long before the
possibility of steam locomotion had become an object of general
inquiry or of public interest.</p>
<p>It has already been observed that up to, and indeed after, the
period of which we speak, there was no such class of skilled
mechanics, nor were there any such machines and tools in use, as
are now available to inventors and manufacturers.&nbsp; Although
skilled workmen were in course of gradual training in a few of
the larger manufacturing towns, they did not, at the date of
Stephenson&rsquo;s patent, exist in any considerable numbers, nor
was there then any class of mechanics capable of constructing
springs of sufficient strength and elasticity to support
locomotive engines of ten tons weight.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the dangers arising from the inequalities of
the road, Stephenson so arranged the boiler of his new patent
locomotive that it was supported upon the frame of the engine by
four cylinders, which opened into the interior of the
boiler.&nbsp; These cylinders were occupied by pistons with rods,
which passed downwards and pressed upon the upper side of the
axles.&nbsp; The cylinders opening into the interior of the
boiler, allowed the pressure of steam to be applied to the upper
side of the piston; and the pressure being nearly equivalent to
one-fourth of the weight of the engine, each axle, whatever might
be its position, had at all times nearly the same amount of
weight to bear, and consequently the entire weight was pretty
equally distributed amongst the four wheels of the
locomotive.&nbsp; Thus the four floating pistons were ingeniously
made to serve the purpose of springs in equalising the weight,
and in softening the jerks of the machine; the weight of which,
it must also be observed, had been increased, on a road
originally calculated to bear a considerably lighter description
of carriage.&nbsp; This mode of supporting the engine remained in
use until the <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>progress of spring-making had so far
advanced that steel springs could be manufactured of sufficient
strength to bear the weight of locomotive engines.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The result of the actual working of the new locomotive on the
improved road amply justified the promises held forth in the
specification.&nbsp; The traffic was conducted with greater
regularity and economy, and the superiority of the engine, as
compared with horse traction, became still more marked.&nbsp; It
is a fact worthy of notice, that the identical engines
constructed in 1816 after the plan above described are to this
day to be seen in regular useful work upon the Killingworth
Railway, conveying heavy coal-trains at the speed of between five
and six miles an hour, probably as economically as any of the
more perfect locomotives now in use.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s endeavours having been attended with
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>such marked success in the adaptation of locomotive
power to railways, his attention was called by many of his
friends, about the year 1818, to the application of steam to
travelling on common roads.&nbsp; It was from this point that the
locomotive started, Trevithick&rsquo;s first engine having been
constructed with this special object.&nbsp; Stephenson&rsquo;s
friends having observed how far behind he had left the original
projector of the locomotive in its application to railroads,
perhaps naturally inferred that he would be equally successful in
applying it to the purpose for which Trevithick and Vivian had
intended their first engine.&nbsp; But the accuracy with which he
estimated the resistance to which loads were exposed on railways,
arising from friction and gravity, led him at a very early stage
to reject the idea of ever applying steam power economically to
common-road travelling.&nbsp; In October, 1818, he made a series
of careful experiments in conjunction with Nicholas Wood, on the
resistance to which carriages were exposed on railways, testing
the results by means of a dynamometer of his own
construction.&nbsp; The series of practical observations made by
means of this instrument were interesting, as the first
systematic attempt to determine the precise amount of resistance
to carriages moving along railways.&nbsp; It was then for the
first time ascertained by experiment that the friction was a
constant quantity at all velocities.&nbsp; Although this theory
had long before been developed by Vince and Coulomb, and was well
known to scientific men as an established truth, yet, at the time
when Stephenson made his experiments, the deductions of
philosophers on the subject were neither believed in nor acted
upon by practical engineers.</p>
<p>He ascertained that the resistances to traction were mainly
three; the first being upon the axles of the carriages, the
second, or rolling resistance, being between the circumference of
the wheel and the surface of the rail, and the third being the
resistance of gravity.&nbsp; The amount of friction and gravity
he could accurately ascertain; but the <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>rolling
resistance was a matter of greater difficulty, being subject to
much variation.&nbsp; He satisfied himself, however, that it was
so great when the surface presented to the wheel was of a rough
character, that the idea of working steam carriages economically
on common roads was dismissed by him as entirely
impracticable.&nbsp; Taking it as 10 lbs to a ton weight on a
level railway, it became obvious to him that so small a rise as 1
in 100 would diminish the useful effort of a locomotive by
upwards of 50 per cent.&nbsp; This was demonstrated by repeated
experiments, and the important fact, thus rooted in his mind, was
never lost sight of in the course of his future railway
career.</p>
<p>It was owing in a great measure to these painstaking
experiments that he early became convinced of the vital
importance, in an economical point of view, of reducing the
country through which a railway was intended to pass as nearly as
possible to a level.&nbsp; Where, as in the first coal railways
of Northumberland and Durham, the load was nearly all one
way,&mdash;that is, from the colliery to the
shipping-place,&mdash;it was an advantage to have an inclination
in that direction.&nbsp; The strain on the powers of the
locomotive was thus diminished, and it was easy for it to haul
the empty waggons back to the colliery up even a pretty steep
incline.&nbsp; But when the loads were both ways, he deemed it of
great importance that the railroad should be constructed as
nearly as possible on a level.</p>
<p>These views, thus early entertained, originated in
Stephenson&rsquo;s mind the peculiar character of railroad works
as distinguished from other roads; for, in railways, he early
contended that large sums would be wisely expended in perforating
barriers of hills with long tunnels, and in raising the lower
levels with the excess cut down from the adjacent high
ground.&nbsp; In proportion as these views forced themselves upon
his mind and were corroborated by his daily experience, he became
more and more convinced of the hopelessness of applying steam
locomotion to common roads; for every argument in favour of a
level railway was, in his <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>view, an
argument against the rough and hilly course of a common road.</p>
<p>Although Stephenson&rsquo;s locomotive engines were in daily
use for many years on the Killingworth Railway, they excited
comparatively little interest.&nbsp; They were no longer
experimental, but had become an established tractive power.&nbsp;
The experience of years had proved that they worked more
steadily, drew heavier loads, and were, on the whole,
considerably more economical than horses.&nbsp; Nevertheless
eight years passed before another locomotive railway was
constructed and opened for the purposes of coal or other
traffic.</p>
<p>Stephenson had no means of bringing his important invention
prominently under the notice of the public.&nbsp; He himself knew
well its importance, and he already anticipated its eventual
general adoption; but being an unlettered man, he could not give
utterance to the thoughts which brooded within him on the
subject.&nbsp; Killingworth Colliery lay far from London, the
centre of scientific life in England.&nbsp; It was visited by no
savans nor literary men, who might have succeeded in introducing
to notice the wonderful machine of Stephenson.&nbsp; Even the
local chroniclers seem to have taken no notice of the
Killingworth Railway.</p>
<p>There seemed, indeed, to be so small a prospect of introducing
the locomotive into general use, that Stephenson,&mdash;perhaps
feeling the capabilities within him,&mdash;again recurred to his
old idea of emigrating to the United States.&nbsp; Before joining
Mr. Burrel as partner in a small foundry at Forth Banks,
Newcastle, he had thrown out to him the suggestion that it would
be a good speculation for them to emigrate to North America, and
introduce steamboats upon the great inland lakes there.&nbsp; The
first steamers were then plying upon the Tyne before his eyes;
and he saw in them the germ of a great revolution in
navigation.&nbsp; It occurred to him that North America presented
the finest field for trying their wonderful powers.&nbsp; He was
an engineer, his partner was an iron-founder; and between them he
thought they might strike out a path to fortune in the <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>mighty West.&nbsp; Fortunately, this idea remained a
mere speculation so far as Stephenson was concerned: and it was
left to others to do what he had dreamt of achieving.&nbsp; After
all his patient waiting, his skill, industry, and perseverance
were at length about to bear fruit.</p>
<p>In 1819 the owners of the Hetton Colliery, in the county of
Durham, determined to have their waggon-way altered to a
locomotive railroad.&nbsp; The result of the working of the
Killingworth Railway had been so satisfactory, that they resolved
to adopt the same system.&nbsp; One reason why an experiment so
long continued and so successful as that at Killingworth should
have been so slow in producing results, perhaps was, that to lay
down a railway and furnish it with locomotives, or fixed engines
where necessary, required a very large capital, beyond the means
of ordinary coal-owners; whilst the small amount of interest felt
in railways by the general public, and the supposed
impracticability of working them to a profit, as yet prevented
ordinary capitalists from venturing their money in the promotion
of such undertakings.&nbsp; The Hetton Coal Company were,
however, possessed of adequate means; and the local reputation of
the Killingworth engine-wright pointed him out as the man best
calculated to lay out their line, and superintend their
works.&nbsp; They accordingly invited him to act as the engineer
of the proposed railway, which was to be the longest locomotive
line that had, up to that time, been constructed.&nbsp; It
extended from the Hetton Colliery, situated about two miles south
of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham, to the
shipping-places on the banks of the Wear, near Sunderland.&nbsp;
Its length was about eight miles; and in its course it crossed
Warden Law, one of the highest hills in the district.&nbsp; The
character of the country forbade the construction of a flat line,
or one of comparatively easy gradients, except by the expenditure
of a much larger capital than was placed at the engineer&rsquo;s
disposal.&nbsp; Heavy works could not be executed; it was
therefore necessary to form the line with but little deviation
from the natural <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>conformation of the district which
it traversed, and also to adapt the mechanical methods employed
for its working to the character of the gradients, which in some
places were necessarily heavy.</p>
<p>Although Stephenson had, with every step made towards its
increased utility, become more and more identified with the
success of the locomotive engine, he did not allow his enthusiasm
to carry him away into costly mistakes.&nbsp; He carefully drew
the line between the cases in which the locomotive could be
usefully employed, and those in which stationary engines were
calculated to be more economical.&nbsp; This led him, as in the
instance of the Hetton Railway, to execute lines through and over
rough countries, where gradients within the powers of the
locomotive engine of that day could not be secured, employing in
their stead stationary engines where locomotives were not
practicable.&nbsp; In the present case, this course was adopted
by him most successfully.&nbsp; On the original Hetton line,
there were five self-acting inclines,&mdash;the full waggons
drawing the empty ones up,&mdash;and two inclines worked by fixed
reciprocating engines of sixty horse power each.&nbsp; The
locomotive travelling engine, or &ldquo;the iron horse,&rdquo; as
the people of the neighbourhood then styled it, did the
rest.&nbsp; On the day of the opening of the Hetton Railway, the
18th November, 1822, crowds of spectators assembled from all
parts to witness the first operations of this ingenious and
powerful machinery, which was entirely successful.&nbsp; On that
day five of Stephenson&rsquo;s locomotives were at work upon the
railway, under the direction of his brother Robert; and the first
shipment of coal was then made by the Hetton Company, at their
new staiths on the Wear.&nbsp; The speed at which the locomotives
travelled was about 4 miles an hour, and each engine dragged
after it a train of 17 waggons, weighing about 64 tons.</p>
<p>While thus advancing step by step,&mdash;attending to the
business of the Killingworth Colliery, and laying out railways in
the neighbourhood,&mdash;he was carefully watching <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>over the education of his son.&nbsp; We have already
seen that Robert was sent to Bruce&rsquo;s school at Newcastle,
where he remained about four years.&nbsp; He left it in the
summer of 1819, and was then put apprentice to Mr. Nicholas Wood,
the head viewer at Killingworth, to learn the business of the
colliery.&nbsp; He served in that capacity for about three years,
during which time he became familiar with most departments of
underground work.&nbsp; The occupation was not unattended with
peril, as the following incident will show.&nbsp; Though the use
of the Geordy lamp had become general in the Killingworth pits,
and the workmen were bound, under a penalty of half-a-crown, not
to use a naked candle, it was difficult to enforce the rule, and
even the masters themselves occasionally broke it.&nbsp; One day
Nicholas Wood, the head viewer, Moodie the under viewer, and
Robert Stephenson, were proceeding along one of the galleries,
Wood with a naked candle in his hand, and Robert following him
with a lamp.&nbsp; They came to a place where a fall of stones
from the roof had taken place, on which Wood, who was first,
proceeded to clamber over the stones, holding high the naked
candle.&nbsp; He had nearly reached the summit of the heap, when
the fire-damp, which had accumulated in the hollow of the roof,
exploded, and instantly the whole party were blown down, and the
lights extinguished.&nbsp; They were a mile from the shaft, and
quite in the dark.&nbsp; There was a rush of the workpeople from
all quarters towards the shaft, for it was feared that the fire
might extend to more dangerous parts of the pit, where, if the
gas had exploded, every soul in the mine must inevitably have
perished.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson and Moodie, on the first
impulse, ran back at full speed along the dark gallery leading to
the shaft, coming into collision, on their way, with the hind
quarters of a horse stunned by the explosion.&nbsp; When they had
gone halfway, Moodie halted, and bethought him of Nicholas
Wood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop, laddie!&rdquo; said he to Robert,
&ldquo;stop; we maun gang back, and seek the
maister.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they retraced their steps.&nbsp;
Happily, no further explosion had <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>taken
place.&nbsp; They found the master lying on the heap of stones,
stunned and bruised, with his hands severely burnt.&nbsp; They
led him to the bottom of the shaft; and he took care afterwards
not to venture into the dangerous parts of the mine without the
protection of a Geordy lamp.</p>
<p>The time that Robert spent at Killingworth as viewer&rsquo;s
apprentice was of advantage both to his father and himself.&nbsp;
The evenings were generally devoted to reading and study, the two
from this time working together as friends and
co-labourers.&nbsp; One who used to drop in at the cottage of an
evening, well remembers the animated and eager discussions which
on some occasions took place, more especially with reference to
the growing powers of the locomotive engine.&nbsp; The son was
even more enthusiastic than the father on this subject.&nbsp;
Robert would suggest numerous alterations and improvements in
details.&nbsp; His father, on the contrary, would offer every
possible objection, defending the existing
arrangements,&mdash;proud, nevertheless of his son&rsquo;s
suggestions, and often warmed and excited by his brilliant
anticipations of the ultimate triumph of the locomotive.</p>
<p>These discussions probably had considerable influence in
inducing Stephenson to take the next important step in the
education of his son.&nbsp; Although Robert, who was only
nineteen years of age, was doing well, and was certain at the
expiration of his apprenticeship to rise to a higher position,
his father was not satisfied with the amount of instruction which
he had as yet given him.&nbsp; Remembering the disadvantages
under which he had himself laboured through his ignorance of
practical chemistry during his investigations connected with the
safety-lamp, more especially with reference to the properties of
gas, as well as in the course of his experiments with the object
of improving the locomotive engine, he determined to furnish his
son with as complete a scientific culture as his means would
afford.&nbsp; He also believed that a proper training in
technical science was indispensable to success in the higher
walks of the engineer&rsquo;s profession; and he determined to
give to his son that kind <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>and degree
of education which he so much desired for himself.&nbsp; He would
thus, he knew, secure a hearty and generous co-worker in the
elaboration of the great ideas now looming before him, and with
their united practical and scientific knowledge he probably felt
that they would be equal to any enterprise.</p>
<p>He accordingly took Robert from his labours as under-viewer in
the West Moor Pit, and in October, 1822, sent him to the
Edinburgh University, there being then no college in England
accessible to persons of moderate means, for purposes of
scientific culture.&nbsp; Robert was furnished with letters of
introduction to several men of literary eminence in Edinburgh;
his father&rsquo;s reputation in connexion with the safety-lamp
being of service to him in this respect.&nbsp; He lodged in
Drummond Street, in the immediate vicinity of the college, and
attended the Chemical Lectures of Dr. Hope, the Natural
Philosophy Lectures of Sir John Leslie, and the Natural History
Class of Professor Jameson.&nbsp; He also devoted several
evenings in each week to the study of practical Chemistry under
Dr. John Murray, himself one of the numerous designers of a
safety-lamp.&nbsp; He took careful notes of all the lectures,
which he copied out at night before he went to bed; so that, when
he returned to Killingworth, he might read them over to his
father.&nbsp; He afterwards had the notes bound up, and placed in
his library.&nbsp; Long years after, when conversing with Thomas
Harrison, C.E., at his house in Gloucester Square, he rose from
his seat and took down a volume from the shelves.&nbsp; Mr.
Harrison observed that the book was in MS., neatly written
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; The
answer was&mdash;&ldquo;When I went to college, I knew the
difficulty my father had in collecting the funds to send me
there.&nbsp; Before going I studied short-hand; while at
Edinburgh, I took down verbatim every lecture; and in the
evenings, before I went to bed, I transcribed those lectures word
for word.&nbsp; You see the result in that range of
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>One of the practical sciences in the study of which
Robert Stephenson took special interest while at Edinburgh was
that of geology.&nbsp; The situation of the city, in the midst of
a district of highly interesting geological formation, easily
accessible to pedestrians, is indeed most favourable to the
pursuit of such a study; and it was the practice of Professor
Jameson frequently to head a band of his pupils, armed with
hammers, chisels, and clinometers, and take them with him on a
long ramble into the country, for the purpose of teaching them
habits of observation and reading to them from the open book of
Nature itself.&nbsp; At the close of this session, the professor
took with him a select body of his pupils on an excursion along
the Great Glen of the Highlands, in the line of the Caledonian
Canal, and Robert formed one of the party.&nbsp; They passed
under the shadow of Ben Nevis, examined the famous old
sea-margins known as the &ldquo;parallel roads of Glen
Roy,&rdquo; and extended their journey as far as Inverness; the
professor teaching the young men as they travelled how to observe
in a mountain country.&nbsp; Not long before his death, Robert
Stephenson spoke in glowing terms of the great pleasure and
benefit which he had derived from that interesting
excursion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have travelled far, and enjoyed
much,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but that delightful botanical and
geological journey I shall never forget; and I am just about to
start in the <i>Titania</i> for a trip round the east coast of
Scotland, returning south through the Caledonian Canal, to
refresh myself with the recollection of that first and brightest
tour of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the summer of 1822 the young student
returned to Killingworth to re-enter upon the active business of
life.&nbsp; The six months&rsquo; study had cost his father
&pound;80; but he was amply repaid by the better scientific
culture which his son had acquired, and the evidence of ability
and industry which he was enabled to exhibit in a prize for
mathematics which he had won at the University.</p>

<span class="smcap">George Stephenson Engineer of the Stockton
and Darlington Railway</span>.</h2>
<p>The district west of Darlington, in Durham, is one of the
richest mineral fields of the North.&nbsp; Vast stores of coal
underlie the Bishop Auckland Valley; and from an early period new
and good roads to market were felt to be exceedingly
desirable.&nbsp; As yet it remained almost a closed field, the
cost of transport of the coal in carts, or on horses&rsquo; or
donkeys&rsquo; backs, greatly limiting the sale.&nbsp; Long ago,
in the days of canal formations, Brindley was consulted about a
canal; afterwards, in 1812, a tramroad was surveyed by Rennie;
and eventually, in 1817, a railway was projected from Darlington
to Stockton-on-Tees.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Of this railway Edward Pease was the projector.&nbsp; A
thoughtful and sagacious man, ready in resources, possessed of
indomitable energy and perseverance, he was eminently <!-- page
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>qualified to undertake what appeared to many the
hopeless enterprise of obtaining an Act for a railway through
such an unpromising district.&nbsp; One who knew him in 1818
said, &ldquo;he was a man who could see a hundred years
ahead.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">When the writer last saw him, in
the autumn of 1854, Mr. Pease was in his eighty-eighth year; yet
he still possessed the hopefulness and mental vigour of a man in
his prime.&nbsp; Hale and hearty, and full of reminiscences of
the past, he continued to take an active interest in all measures
calculated to render men happier and better.&nbsp; Still sound in
health, his eye had not lost its brilliancy, nor his cheek its
colour; <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>and there was an elasticity in his
step which younger men might have envied. <a
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a></p>
<p>In getting up a company for surveying and forming a railway,
Mr. Pease had great difficulties to encounter.&nbsp; The people
of the neighbourhood spoke of it as a ridiculous undertaking, and
predicted that it would be ruinous to all concerned.&nbsp; Even
those most interested in the opening of new markets for their
coal, were indifferent, if not actually hostile.&nbsp; The
Stockton merchants and shipowners, whom it was calculated so
greatly to benefit, gave the project no support; and not twenty
shares were subscribed for in the whole town.&nbsp; Mr. Pease
nevertheless persevered; and he induced many of his friends and
relations to subscribe the capital required.</p>
<p>The necessary preliminary steps were taken in 1818 to apply
for an act to authorise the construction of a tramroad from
Witton to Stockton.&nbsp; The measure was however, strongly
opposed by the Duke of Cleveland, because the proposed line
passed close by one of his fox covers; and the bill was
rejected.&nbsp; A new survey was then made, avoiding the
Duke&rsquo;s cover; and in 1819 a renewed application was made to
Parliament.&nbsp; The promoters were this time successful, and
the royal assent was given to the first Stockton and Darlington
Railway Act on the 19th April, 1821.</p>
<p>The projectors did not originally contemplate the employment
of locomotives.&nbsp; The Act provided for the making and
maintaining of tramroads for the passage &ldquo;of waggons and
other carriages&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>with men and horses</i> or
otherwise,&rdquo; and a further clause made provision for damages
done in course of traffic by the &ldquo;waggoners.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The public were to be free &ldquo;to use with horses, cattle and
carriages,&rdquo; the roads formed by the company, on payment of
the authorised rates, &ldquo;between the hours of seven in the
morning and six in the evening,&rdquo; during winter;
&ldquo;between six in the morning and <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>eight in
the evening,&rdquo; in two of the spring and autumn months; and
&ldquo;between five in the morning and ten in the evening,&rdquo;
in the summer months of May, June, July, and August.&nbsp; From
this it will be obvious that the projectors of the line had
themselves at first no very large conceptions as to the scope of
their project.</p>
<p>One day, in the spring of 1821, two strangers knocked at the
door of Mr. Pease&rsquo;s house in Darlington; and the message
was brought to him that some persons from Killingworth wanted to
speak with him.&nbsp; They were invited in, on which one of the
visitors introduced himself as Nicholas Wood, viewer at
Killingworth, and then turning to his companion, he introduced
him as George Stephenson, engine-wright, of the same place.</p>
<p>Mr. Pease entered into conversation with his visitors, and was
soon told their object.&nbsp; Stephenson had heard of the passing
of the Stockton and Darlington Act, and desiring to increase his
railway experience, and also to employ in some larger field the
practical knowledge he had already gained, he determined to visit
the known projector of the undertaking, with the view of being
employed to carry it out.&nbsp; He had brought with him his
friend Wood, for the purpose at the same time of relieving his
diffidence, and supporting his application.</p>
<p>Mr. Pease liked the appearance of his visitor: &ldquo;there
was,&rdquo; as he afterwards remarked when speaking of
Stephenson, &ldquo;such an honest, sensible look about him, and
he seemed so modest and unpretending.&nbsp; He spoke in the
strong Northumbrian dialect of his district, and described
himself as &lsquo;only the engine-wright at Killingworth;
that&rsquo;s what he was.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pease soon saw that our engineer was the very man for his
purpose.&nbsp; The whole plans of the railway were still in an
undetermined state, and Mr. Pease was therefore glad to have the
opportunity of profiting by Stephenson&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp;
In the course of their conversation, the latter strongly
recommended a <i>railway</i> in preference to a <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>tramroad.&nbsp; They also discussed the kind of
tractive power to be employed: Mr. Pease stating that the company
had based their whole calculations on the employment of
<i>horse</i> power.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so satisfied,&rdquo; said
he afterwards, &ldquo;that a horse upon an iron road would draw
ten tons for one ton on a common road, that I felt sure that
before long the railway would become the King&rsquo;s
highway.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Pease was scarcely prepared for the
bold assertion made by his visitor, that the locomotive engine
with which he had been working the Killingworth Railway for many
years past was worth fifty horses, and that engines made after a
similar plan would yet entirely supersede all horse power upon
railroads.&nbsp; Stephenson was daily becoming more positive as
to the superiority of his locomotive; and hence he strongly urged
Mr. Pease to adopt it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come over to
Killingworth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and see what my engines can
do; seeing is believing, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pease accordingly
promised that on some early day he would go over to Killingworth,
and take a look at the wonderful machine that was to supersede
horses.&nbsp; The result of the interview was, that Mr. Pease
promised to bring Stephenson&rsquo;s application for the
appointment of engineer before the Directors, and to support it
with his influence; whereon the two visitors prepared to take
their leave, informing Mr. Pease that they intended to return to
Newcastle &ldquo;by nip;&rdquo; that is, they expected to get a
smuggled lift on the stage-coach, by tipping Jehu,&mdash;for in
those days the stage coachmen regarded all casual roadside
passengers as their proper perquisites.&nbsp; They had, however,
been so much engrossed by their conversation, that the lapse of
time was forgotten, and when Stephenson and his friend made
enquiries about the return coach, they found the last had left;
and they had to walk the 18 miles to Durham on their way back to
Newcastle.</p>
<p>Mr. Pease having made further inquiries respecting
Stephenson&rsquo;s character and qualifications, and having
received a very strong recommendation of him as the right man for
the intended work, he brought the subject of his <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>application before the directors of the Stockton and
Darlington Company.&nbsp; They resolved to adopt his
recommendation that a railway be formed instead of a tramroad;
and they further requested Mr. Pease to write to Stephenson,
desiring him to undertake a re-survey of the line at the earliest
practicable period.</p>
<p>A man was despatched on a horse with the letter, and when he
reached Killingworth he made diligent enquiry after the person
named upon the address, &ldquo;George Stephenson, Esquire,
Engineer.&rdquo;&nbsp; No such person was known in the
village.&nbsp; It is said that the man was on the point of giving
up all further search, when the happy thought struck some of the
colliers&rsquo; wives who had gathered about him, that it must be
&ldquo;Geordie the engine-wright&rdquo; the man was in search of;
and to Geordie&rsquo;s cottage he accordingly went, found him at
home, and delivered the letter.</p>
<p>About the end of September, Stephenson went carefully over the
line of the proposed railway, for the purpose of suggesting such
improvements and deviations as he might consider desirable.&nbsp;
He was accompanied by an assistant and a chainman,&mdash;his son
Robert entering the figures while his father took the
sights.&nbsp; After being engaged in the work at intervals for
about six weeks, Stephenson reported the result of his survey to
the Board of Directors, and showed that by certain deviations, a
line shorter by about three miles might be constructed at a
considerable saving in expense, while at the same time more
favourable gradients&mdash;an important consideration&mdash;would
be secured.</p>
<p>It was, however, determined in the first place to proceed with
the works at those parts of the line where no deviation was
proposed; and the first rail of the Stockton and Darlington
Railway was laid with considerable ceremony, near Stockton, on
the 23rd May, 1822.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that Stephenson, in making his first
estimate of the cost of forming the railway according to the
Instructions of the directors, set down, as part of the cost,
&pound;6200 for stationary engines, not mentioning locomotives at
all.&nbsp; <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>The directors as yet confined their
views to the employment only of horses for the haulage of the
coals, and of fixed engines and ropes where horse-power was not
applicable.&nbsp; The whole question of steam locomotive power
was, in the estimation of the public, as well as of practical and
scientific men, as yet in doubt.&nbsp; The confident
anticipations of George Stephenson, as to the eventual success of
locomotive engines, were regarded as mere speculations; and when
he gave utterance to his views, as he frequently took the
opportunity of doing, it even had the effect of shaking the
confidence of some of his friends in the solidity of his judgment
and his practical qualities as an engineer.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pease discussed the question with Stephenson, his
remark was, &ldquo;Come over and see my engines at Killingworth,
and satisfy yourself as to the efficiency of the
locomotive.&nbsp; I will show you the colliery books, that you
may ascertain for yourself the actual cost of working.&nbsp; And
I must tell you that the economy of the locomotive engine is no
longer a matter of theory, but a matter of fact.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
confident was the tone in which Stephenson spoke of the success
of his engines, and so important were the consequences involved
in arriving at a correct conclusion on the subject, that Mr.
Pease at length resolved upon paying a visit to Killingworth in
the summer of 1822, to see with his own eyes the wonderful new
power so much vaunted by the engineer.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pease arrived at Killingworth village, he inquired
for George Stephenson, and was told that he must go over to the
West Moor, and seek for a cottage by the roadside, with a dial
over the door&mdash;&ldquo;that was where George Stephenson
lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; They soon found the house with the dial; and
on knocking, the door was opened by Mrs. Stephenson&mdash;his
second wife (Elizabeth Hindmarsh), the daughter of a farmer at
Black Callerton, whom he had married in 1820. <a
name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a>&nbsp; Her husband, she said, was not
in the <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>house at present, but she would send
for him to the colliery.&nbsp; And in a short time Stephenson
appeared before them in his working dress, just as he had come
out of the pit.</p>
<p>He very soon had his locomotive brought up to the crossing
close by the end of the cottage,&mdash;made the gentlemen mount
it, and showed them its paces.&nbsp; Harnessing it to a train of
loaded waggons, he ran it along the railroad, and so thoroughly
satisfied his visitors of its power and capabilities, that from
that day Edward Pease was a declared supporter of the locomotive
engine.&nbsp; In preparing the Amended Stockton and Darlington
Act, at Stephenson&rsquo;s urgent request Mr. Pease had a clause
inserted, taking power to work the railway by means of locomotive
engines, and to employ them for the haulage of passengers as well
as of merchandise. <a name="citation130"></a><a
href="#footnote130" class="citation">[130]</a>&nbsp; The Act was
obtained in 1823, on which Stephenson was appointed the
company&rsquo;s engineer at a salary of &pound;300 per annum; and
it was determined that the line should be constructed and opened
for traffic as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>He at once proceeded, accompanied by his assistants, with the
working survey of the line, laying out every foot of the ground
himself.&nbsp; Railway surveying was as yet in its infancy, and
was slow and difficult work.&nbsp; It afterwards became a
separate branch of railway business, and was entrusted to a
special staff.&nbsp; Indeed on no subsequent line did George
Stephenson take the sights through the spirit <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>level with
his own hands and eyes as he did on this railway.&nbsp; He
started very early&mdash;dressed in a blue tailed coat, breeches,
and top-boots&mdash;and surveyed until dusk.&nbsp; He was not at
any time particular as to his living; and during the survey, he
took his chance of getting a little milk and bread at some
cottager&rsquo;s house along the line, or occasionally joined in
a homely dinner at some neighbouring farmhouse.&nbsp; The country
people were accustomed to give him a hearty welcome when he
appeared at their door; for he was always full of cheery and
homely talk, and, when there were children about the house, he
had plenty of humorous chat for them as well as for their
seniors.</p>
<p>After the day&rsquo;s work was over, George would drop in at
Mr. Pease&rsquo;s, to talk over the progress of the survey, and
discuss various matters connected with the railway.&nbsp; Mr.
Pease&rsquo;s daughters were usually present; and on one
occasion, finding the young ladies learning the art of
embroidery, he volunteered to instruct them. <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I know all about
it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and you will wonder how I learnt
it.&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; When I was a brakesman at
Killingworth, I learnt the art of embroidery while working the
pitmen&rsquo;s buttonholes by the engine fire at
nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was never ashamed, but on the contrary
rather proud, of reminding his friends of these humble pursuits
of his early life.&nbsp; Mr. Pease&rsquo;s family were greatly
pleased with his conversation, which was always amusing and
instructive; full of all sorts of experience, gathered in the
oddest and most out-of-the-way places.&nbsp; Even at that early
period, before he mixed in the society of educated persons, there
was a dash of speculativeness in his remarks, which gave a high
degree of originality to his conversation; and he would
sometimes, in a casual remark, throw a flash of light upon a
subject, which called up a train of pregnant suggestions.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>One of the most important subjects of discussion at
these meetings with Mr. Pease, was the establishment of a
manufactory at Newcastle for the building of locomotive
engines.&nbsp; Up to this time all the locomotives constructed
after Stephenson&rsquo;s designs, had been made by ordinary
mechanics working among the collieries in the North of
England.&nbsp; But he had long felt that the accuracy and style
of their workmanship admitted of great improvement, and that upon
this the more perfect action of the locomotive engine, and its
general adoption, in a great measure depended.&nbsp; One great
object that he had in view in establishing the proposed factory
was, to concentrate a number of good workmen, for the purpose of
carrying out the improvements in detail which he was constantly
making in his engine.&nbsp; He felt hampered by the want of
efficient help from skilled mechanics, who could work out in a
practical form the ideas of which his busy mind was always so
prolific.&nbsp; Doubtless, too, he believed that the manufactory
would prove a remunerative investment, and that, on the general
adoption of the railway system which he anticipated, he would
derive solid advantages from the fact of his establishment being
the only one of the kind for the special construction of
locomotive engines.</p>
<p>Mr. Pease approved of his design, and strongly recommended him
to carry it into effect.&nbsp; But there was the question of
means; and Stephenson did not think he had capital enough for the
purpose.&nbsp; He told Mr. Pease that he could advance
&pound;1000&mdash;the amount of the testimonial presented by the
coal-owners for his safety-lamp invention, which he had still
left untouched; but he did not think this sufficient for the
purpose, and he thought that he should require at least another
&pound;1000.&nbsp; Mr. Pease had been very much struck with the
successful performances of the Killingworth engine; and being an
accurate judge of character, he believed that he could not go far
wrong in linking a portion of his fortune with the energy and
industry of George Stephenson.&nbsp; He consulted his friend
Thomas <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Richardson in the matter; and the
two consented to advance &pound;500 each for the purpose of
establishing the engine factory at Newcastle.&nbsp; A piece of
land was accordingly purchased in Forth Street, in August, 1823,
on which a small building was erected&mdash;the nucleus of the
gigantic establishment which was afterwards formed around it; and
active operations were begun early in 1824.</p>
<p>While the Stockton and Darlington Railway works were in
progress, our engineer had many interesting discussions with Mr.
Pease, on points connected with its construction and working, the
determination of which in a great measure affected the formation
and working of all future railways.&nbsp; The most important
points were these:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The comparative merits of cast and wrought iron
rails.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The gauge of the railway.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The employment of horse or engine power in working
it, when ready for traffic.</p>
<p>The kind of rails to be laid down to form the permanent road
was a matter of considerable importance.&nbsp; A wooden tramroad
had been contemplated when the first Act was applied for; but
Stephenson having advised that an iron road should be laid down,
he was instructed to draw up a specification of the rails.&nbsp;
He went before the directors to discuss with them the kind of
material to be specified.&nbsp; He was himself interested in the
patent for cast-iron rails, which he had taken out in conjunction
with Mr. Losh in 1816; and, of course, it was to his interest
that his articles should be used.&nbsp; But when requested to
give his opinion on the subject, he frankly said to the
directors, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, to tell you the truth,
although it would put &pound;500 in my pocket to specify my own
patent rails, I cannot do so after the experience I have
had.&nbsp; If you take my advice, you will not lay down a single
cast-iron rail.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the
directors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because they will not stand the weight,
and you will be at no end of expense for repairs and
relays.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of road, then,&rdquo; he
was asked, &ldquo;would you recommend?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Malleable rails, certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and I
can recommend them with the <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>more
confidence from the fact that at Killingworth we have had some
Swedish bars laid down&mdash;nailed to wooden sleepers&mdash;for
a period of fourteen years, the waggons passing over them daily;
and there they are, in use yet, whereas the cast rails are
constantly giving way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The price of malleable rails was, however, so high&mdash;being
then worth about &pound;12 per ton as compared with cast-iron
rails at about &pound;5 10s.&mdash;and the saving of expense was
so important a consideration with the subscribers, that
Stephenson was directed to provide, in the specification, that
only one-half of the rails required&mdash;or about 800
tons&mdash;should be of malleable iron, and the remainder of
cast-iron.&nbsp; The malleable rails were of the kind called
&ldquo;fish-bellied,&rdquo; and weighed 28 lbs. to the yard,
being 2&frac14; inches broad at the top, with the upper flange
&frac34; inch thick.&nbsp; They were only 2 inches in depth at
the points at which they rested on the chairs, and 3&frac14;
inches in the middle or bellied part.</p>
<p>When forming the road, the proper gauge had also to be
determined.&nbsp; What width was this to be?&nbsp; The gauge of
the first tramroad laid down had virtually settled the
point.&nbsp; The gauge of wheels of the common vehicles of the
country&mdash;of the carts and waggons employed on common roads,
which were first used on the tramroads&mdash;was about 4 feet
8&frac12; inches.&nbsp; And so the first tramroads were laid down
of this gauge.&nbsp; The tools and machinery for constructing
coal-waggons and locomotives were formed with this gauge in
view.&nbsp; The Wylam waggon-way, afterwards the Wylam plate-way,
the Killingworth railroad, and the Hetton rail road, were as
nearly as possible on the same gauge.&nbsp; Some of the
earth-waggons used to form the Stockton and Darlington road were
brought from the Hetton railway; and others which were specially
constructed were formed of the same dimensions, these being
intended to be afterwards employed in the working of the
traffic.</p>
<p>As the period drew near for the opening of the line, the
question of the tractive power to be employed was anxiously <!--
page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>discussed.&nbsp; At the Brusselton incline, fixed
engines must necessarily be made use of; but with respect to the
mode of working the railway generally, it was decided that horses
were to be largely employed, and arrangements were made for their
purchase.&nbsp; The influence of Mr. Pease also secured that a
fair trial should be given to the experiment of working the
traffic by locomotive power; and three engines were ordered from
the firm of Stephenson and Co., Newcastle, which were put in hand
forthwith, in anticipation of the opening of the railway.&nbsp;
These were constructed after Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s most matured
designs, and embodied all the improvements which he had contrived
up to that time.&nbsp; No. I. engine, the
&ldquo;Locomotion,&rdquo; which was first delivered, weighed
about eight tons.&nbsp; It had one large flue or tube through the
boiler, by which the heated air passed direct from the furnace at
one end, lined with fire-bricks, to the chimney at the
other.&nbsp; The combustion in the furnace was quickened by the
adoption of the steam-blast in the chimney.&nbsp; The heat raised
was sometimes so great, and it was so imperfectly abstracted by
the surrounding water, that the chimney became almost
red-hot.&nbsp; Such engines, when put to their speed, were found
capable of running at the rate of from twelve to sixteen miles an
hour; but they were better adapted for the heavy work of hauling
coal-trains at low speeds&mdash;for which, indeed, they were
specially constructed&mdash;than for running at the higher speeds
afterwards adopted.&nbsp; Nor was it contemplated by the
directors as possible, at the time when they were ordered, that
locomotives could be made available for the purposes of passenger
travelling.&nbsp; Besides, the Stockton and Darlington Railway
did not run through a district in which passengers were supposed
to be likely to constitute any considerable portion of the
traffic.</p>
<p>We may easily imagine the anxiety felt by Mr. Stephenson
during the progress of the works towards completion, and his
mingled hopes and doubts (though his doubts were but few) as to
the issue of this great experiment.&nbsp; When <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the
formation of the line near Stockton was well advanced, Mr.
Stephenson one day, accompanied by his son Robert and John Dixon,
made a journey of inspection of the works.&nbsp; The party
reached Stockton, and proceeded to dine at one of the inns
there.&nbsp; After dinner, Stephenson ventured on the very
unusual measure of ordering in a bottle of wine, to drink success
to the railway.&nbsp; John Dixon relates with pride the utterance
of the master on the occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo;
said he to the two young men, &ldquo;I venture to tell you that I
think you will live to see the day when railways will supersede
almost all other methods of conveyance in this country&mdash;when
mail-coaches will go by railway, and railroads will become the
great highway for the king and all his subjects.&nbsp; The time
is coming when it will be cheaper for a working man to travel
upon a railway than to walk on foot.&nbsp; I know there are great
and almost insurmountable difficulties to be encountered; but
what I have said will come to pass as sure as you live.&nbsp; I
only wish I may live to see the day, though that I can scarcely
hope for, as I know how slow all human progress is, and with what
difficulty I have been able to get the locomotive thus far
adopted, notwithstanding my more than ten years&rsquo; successful
experiment at Killingworth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result, however,
outstripped even the most sanguine anticipations of Stephenson;
and his son Robert, shortly after his return from America in
1827, saw his father&rsquo;s locomotive generally employed as the
tractive power on railways.</p>
<p>The Stockton and Darlington line was opened for traffic on the
27th September, 1825.&nbsp; An immense concourse of people
assembled from all parts to witness the ceremony of opening this
first public railway.&nbsp; The powerful opposition which the
project had encountered, the threats which were still uttered
against the company by the road-trustees and others, who declared
that they would yet prevent the line being worked, and perhaps
the general unbelief as to its success which still prevailed,
tended to excite the curiosity of the public as to the
result.&nbsp; Some went to rejoice at the <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>opening,
some to see the &ldquo;bubble burst;&rdquo; and there were many
prophets of evil who would not miss the blowing up of the boasted
travelling engine.&nbsp; The opening was, however,
auspicious.&nbsp; The proceedings commenced at Brusselton
Incline, about nine miles above Darlington, where the fixed
engine drew a train of loaded waggons up the incline from the
west, and lowered them on the east side.&nbsp; At the foot of the
incline a locomotive was in readiness to receive them, Stephenson
himself driving the engine.&nbsp; The train consisted of six
waggons loaded with coals and flour; after these was the
passenger-coach, filled with the directors and their friends, and
then twenty-one waggons fitted up with temporary seats for
passengers; and lastly came six waggon-loads of coals, making in
all a train of thirty-eight vehicles.&nbsp; The local chronicler
of the day almost went beside himself in describing the
extraordinary event:&mdash;&ldquo;The signal being given,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;the engine started off with this immense train of
carriages; and such was its velocity, that in some parts the
speed was frequently 12 miles an hour!&rdquo;&nbsp; By the time
it reached Stockton there were about 600 persons in the train or
hanging on to the waggons, which must have gone at a safe and
steady pace of from four to six miles an hour from
Darlington.&nbsp; &ldquo;The arrival at Stockton,&rdquo; it is
added, &ldquo;excited a deep interest and admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The working of the line then commenced, and the results were
such as to surprise even the most sanguine of its
projectors.&nbsp; The traffic upon which they had formed their
estimates of profit proved to be small in comparison with that
which flowed in upon them which they had never dreamt of.&nbsp;
Thus, what the company had principally relied upon for their
receipts was the carriage of coals for land sale at the stations
along the line, whereas the haulage of coals to the seaports for
exportation to the London market was not contemplated as
possible.&nbsp; When the bill was before Parliament, Mr. Lambton
(afterwards Earl of Durham) succeeded in getting a clause
inserted, limiting <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the charge for the haulage of all
coal to Stockton-on-Tees for the purpose of shipment to
&frac12;d. per ton per mile; whereas a rate of 4d. per ton was
allowed to be taken for all coals led upon the railway for land
sale.&nbsp; Mr. Lambton&rsquo;s object in enforcing the low rate
of &frac12;d. was to protect his own trade in coal exported from
Sunderland and the northern ports.&nbsp; He believed, in common
with everybody else, that the &frac12;d. rate would effectually
secure him against competition on the part of the Company; for it
was not considered possible to lead coals at that price, and the
proprietors of the railway themselves considered that such a rate
would be utterly ruinous.&nbsp; The projectors never contemplated
sending more than 10,000 tons a year to Stockton, and those only
for shipment as ballast; they looked for their profits almost
exclusively to the land sale.&nbsp; The result, however, was as
surprising to them as it must have been to Mr. Lambton.&nbsp; The
&frac12;d. rate which was forced upon them, instead of being
ruinous, proved the vital element in the success of the
railway.&nbsp; In the course of a few years, the annual shipment
of coal, led by the Stockton and Darlington Railway to Stockton
and Middlesborough, was more than 500,000 tons; and it has since
far exceeded this amount.&nbsp; Instead of being, as anticipated,
a subordinate branch of traffic, it proved, in fact, the main
traffic, while the land sale was merely subsidiary.</p>
<p>The anticipations of the company as to passenger traffic were
in like manner more than realised.&nbsp; At first, passengers
were not thought of; and it was only while the works were in
progress that the starting of a passenger coach was seriously
contemplated.&nbsp; The number of persons travelling between the
two towns was very small; and it was not known whether these
would risk their persons upon the iron road.&nbsp; It was
determined, however, to make trial of a railway coach; and Mr.
Stephenson was authorised to have one built at Newcastle, at the
cost of the company.&nbsp; This was done accordingly; and the
first railway passenger carriage was built after our
engineer&rsquo;s design.&nbsp; It was, <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>however, a
very modest, and indeed a somewhat uncouth machine, more
resembling the caravans still to be seen at country fairs
containing the &ldquo;Giant and the Dwarf&rdquo; and other
wonders of the world, than a passenger-coach of any extant
form.&nbsp; A row of seats ran along each side of the interior,
and a long deal table was fixed in the centre; the access being
by means of a door at the back end, in the manner of an
omnibus.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

src="images/p139.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This coach arrived from Newcastle the day before the opening,
and formed part of the railway procession above described.&nbsp;
Mr. Stephenson was consulted as to the name of the coach, and he
at once suggested &ldquo;The Experiment;&rdquo; and by this name
it was called.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s arms were afterwards
painted on her side, with the motto &ldquo;Periculum privatum
utilitas publica.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the sole
passenger-carrying stock of the Stockton and Darlington Company
in the year 1825.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;Experiment&rdquo; proved
the forerunner of a mighty traffic: and long time did not elapse
before it was displaced, not only by improved <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>coaches
(still drawn by horses), but afterwards by long trains of
passenger-carriages drawn by locomotive engines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Experiment&rdquo; was fairly started as a
passenger-coach on the 10th October, 1825, a fortnight after the
opening of the line.&nbsp; It was drawn by one horse, and
performed a journey daily each way between the two towns,
accomplishing the distance of twelve miles in about two
hours.&nbsp; The fare charged was a shilling without distinction
of class; and each passenger was allowed fourteen pounds of
luggage free.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Experiment&rdquo; was not,
however, worked by the company, but was let to contractors who
worked it under an arrangement whereby toll was paid for the use
of the line, rent of booking-cabins, etc.</p>
<p>The speculation answered so well, that several private
coaching companies were shortly after got up by innkeepers at
Darlington and Stockton, for the purpose of running other coaches
upon the railroad; and an active competition for passenger
traffic sprang up.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Experiment&rdquo; being found
too heavy for one horse to draw, besides being found an
uncomfortable machine, was banished to the coal district.&nbsp;
Its place was then supplied by other and better
vehicles,&mdash;though they were no other than old stage-coach
bodies purchased by the company, and each mounted upon an
underframe with flange-wheels.&nbsp; These were let on hire to
the coaching companies, who horsed and managed them under an
arrangement as to tolls, in like manner as the
&ldquo;Experiment&rdquo; had been worked.&nbsp; Now began the
distinction of inside and outside passengers, equivalent to first
and second class, paying different fares.&nbsp; The competition
with each other upon the railway, and with the ordinary
stagecoaches upon the road, soon brought up the speed, which was
increased to ten miles an hour&mdash;the mail-coach rate of
travelling in those days, and considered very fast.</p>
<p>Mr. Clephan, a native of the district, has described some of
the curious features of the competition between the rival coach
companies:&mdash;&ldquo;There were two separate coach companies
in Stockton, and amusing collisions sometimes occurred <!-- page
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>between the drivers&mdash;who found on the rail a novel
element for contention.&nbsp; Coaches cannot pass each other on
the rail as on the road; and, as the line was single, with four
sidings in the mile, when two coaches met, or two trains, or
coach and train, the question arose which of the drivers must go
back?&nbsp; This was not always settled in silence.&nbsp; As to
trains, it came to be a sort of understanding that empty should
give way to loaded waggons; and as to trains and coaches, that
the passengers should have preference over coals; while coaches,
when they met, must quarrel it out.&nbsp; At length, midway
between sidings, a post was erected, and a rule was laid down
that he who had passed the pillar must go on, and the
&lsquo;coming man&rsquo; go back.&nbsp; At the Goose Pool and
Early Nook, it was common for these coaches to stop; and there,
as Jonathan would say, passengers and coachmen
&lsquo;liquored.&rsquo;&nbsp; One coach, introduced by an
innkeeper, was a compound of two mourning-coaches,&mdash;an
approximation to the real railway-coach, which still adheres,
with multiplying exceptions, to the stage-coach type.&nbsp; One
Dixon, who drove the &lsquo;Experiment&rsquo; between Darlington
and Shildon, is the inventor of carriage-lighting on the
rail.&nbsp; On a dark winter night, having compassion on his
passengers, he would buy a penny candle, and place it lighted
amongst them on the table of the
&lsquo;Experiment&rsquo;&mdash;the first railway-coach (which, by
the way, ended its days at Shildon as a railway cabin), being
also the first coach on the rail (first, second, and third class
jammed all into one) that indulged its customers with light in
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traffic of all sorts increased so steadily and so rapidly
that considerable difficulty was experienced in working it
satisfactorily.&nbsp; It had been provided by the first Stockton
and Darlington Act that the line should be free to all parties
who chose to use it at certain prescribed rates, and that any
person might put horses and waggons on the railway, and carry for
himself.&nbsp; But this arrangement led to increasing confusion
and difficulty, and could not continue in the face of a large and
rapidly-increasing traffic.&nbsp; The <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>goods
trains got so long that the carriers found it necessary to call
in the aid of the locomotive engine to help them on their
way.&nbsp; Then mixed trains of passengers and merchandise began
to run; and the result was that the railway company found it
necessary to take the entire charge and working of the
traffic.&nbsp; In course of time new coaches were specially built
for the better accommodation of the public, until at length
regular passenger-trains were run, drawn by the locomotive
engine,&mdash;though this was not until after the Liverpool and
Manchester Company had established this as a distinct branch of
their traffic.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The three Stephenson locomotives were from the first regularly
employed to work the coal trains; and their proved efficiency for
this purpose led to the gradual increase of the locomotive
power.&nbsp; The speed of the engines&mdash;slow though it seems
now&mdash;was in those days regarded as something
marvellous.&nbsp; A race actually came off between No. I. <!--
page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>engine, the &ldquo;Locomotion,&rdquo; and one of the
stage-coaches travelling from Darlington to Stockton by the
ordinary road; and it was regarded as a great triumph of
mechanical skill that the locomotive reached Stockton first,
beating the stage-coach by about a hundred yards!&nbsp; The same
engine continued in good working order in the year 1846, when it
headed the railway procession on the opening of the
Middlesborough and Redcar Railway, travelling at the rate of
about fourteen miles an hour.&nbsp; This engine, the first that
travelled upon the first public railway, has recently been placed
upon a pedestal in front of the railway station at
Darlington.</p>
<p>For some years, however, the principal haulage of the line was
performed by horses.&nbsp; The inclination of the gradients being
towards the sea, this was perhaps the cheapest mode of traction,
so long as the traffic was not very large.&nbsp; The horse drew
the train along the level road, until, on reaching a descending
gradient, down which the train ran by its own gravity, the animal
was unharnessed, and, when loose, he wheeled round to the other
end of the waggons, to which a &ldquo;dandy-cart&rdquo; was
attached, its bottom being only a few inches from the rail.&nbsp;
Bringing his step into unison with the speed of the train, the
horse learnt to leap nimbly into his place in this waggon, which
was usually fitted with a well-filled hay-rack.</p>
<p>The details of the working were gradually perfected by
experience, the projectors of the line being scarcely conscious
at first of the importance and significance of the work which
they had taken in hand, and little thinking that they were laying
the foundations of a system which was yet to revolutionise the
internal communications of the world, and confer the greatest
blessings on mankind.&nbsp; It is important to note that the
commercial results of the enterprise were considered satisfactory
from the opening of the railway.&nbsp; Besides conferring a great
public benefit upon the inhabitants of the district and throwing
open entirely new markets for coal, the profits derived from the
traffic <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>created by the railway yielded
increasing dividends to those who had risked their capital in the
undertaking, and thus held forth an encouragement to the
projectors of railways generally, which was not without an
important effect in stimulating the projection of similar
enterprises in other districts.&nbsp; These results, as displayed
in the annual dividends, must have been eminently encouraging to
the astute commercial men of Liverpool and Manchester, who were
then engaged in the prosecution of their railway.&nbsp; Indeed,
the commercial success of the Stockton and Darlington Company may
be justly characterised as the turning-point of the railway
system.</p>
<p>Before leaving this subject, we cannot avoid alluding to one
of its most remarkable and direct results&mdash;the creation of
the town of Middlesborough-on-Tees.&nbsp; When the railway was
opened in 1825, the site of this future metropolis of Cleveland
was occupied by one solitary farmhouse and its
outbuildings.&nbsp; All round was pasture-land or mud-banks;
scarcely another house was within sight.&nbsp; In 1829 some of
the principal proprietors of the railway joined in the purchase
of about 500 or 600 acres of land five miles below
Stockton&mdash;the site of the modern Middlesborough&mdash;for
the purpose of there forming a new seaport for the shipment of
coals brought to the Tees by the railway.&nbsp; The line was
accordingly extended thither; docks were excavated; a town sprang
up; churches, chapels, and schools were built, with a
custom-house, mechanics&rsquo; institute, banks, shipbuilding
yards, and iron-factories.&nbsp; In ten years a busy population
of some 6000 persons (since increased to about 23,000) occupied
the site of the original farmhouse. <a name="citation144"></a><a
href="#footnote144" class="citation">[144]</a>&nbsp; More
recently, the discovery <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of vast
stores of ironstone in the Cleveland Hills, closely adjoining
Middlesborough, has tended still more rapidly to augment the
population and increase the commercial importance of the
place.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to relate, in connexion with this great
work&mdash;the Stockton and Darlington Railway, projected by
Edward Pease and executed by George Stephenson&mdash;that when
Mr. Stephenson became a prosperous and a celebrated man, he did
not forget the friend who had taken him by the hand, and helped
him on in his early days.&nbsp; He continued to remember Mr.
Pease with gratitude and affection, and that gentleman, to the
close of his life, was proud to exhibit a handsome gold watch,
received as a gift from his celebrated
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, bearing these
words;&mdash;&ldquo;Esteem and gratitude: from George Stephenson
to Edward Pease.&rdquo;</p>

class="pagenum">p. 146</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Liverpool and Manchester Railway
projected</span>.</h2>
<p>The rapid growth of the trade and manufactures of South
Lancashire gave rise, about the year 1821, to the project of a
tramroad for the conveyance of goods between Liverpool and
Manchester.&nbsp; Since the construction of the Bridgewater Canal
by Brindley, some fifty years before, the increase in the
business transacted between the two towns had become quite
marvellous.&nbsp; The steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, and the
canal, working together, had accumulated in one focus a vast
aggregate of population, manufactures, and trade.</p>
<p>Such was the expansion of business caused by the inventions to
which we have referred, that the navigation was found altogether
inadequate to accommodate the traffic, which completely outgrew
all the Canal Companies&rsquo; appliances of wharves, boats, and
horses.&nbsp; Cotton lay at Liverpool for weeks together, waiting
to be removed; and it occupied a longer time to transport the
cargoes from Liverpool to Manchester than it had done to bring
them across the Atlantic from the United States to England.&nbsp;
Carts and waggons were tried, but proved altogether
insufficient.&nbsp; Sometimes manufacturing operations had to be
suspended altogether, and during a frost, when the canals were
frozen up, the communication was entirely stopped.&nbsp; The
consequences were often disastrous, alike to operatives,
merchants, and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Expostulation with the Canal Companies was of no use.&nbsp;
They were overcrowded with business at their own prices, and
disposed to be very dictatorial.&nbsp; When the Duke first
constructed his canal, he had to encounter the fierce opposition
of the Irwell and Mersey Navigation, whose monopoly <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>his new line of water conveyance threatened to
interfere with. <a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a>&nbsp; But the innovation of one
generation often becomes the obstruction of the next.&nbsp; The
Duke&rsquo;s agents would scarcely listen to the remonstrances of
the Liverpool merchants and Manchester manufacturers, and the
Bridgewater Canal was accordingly, in its turn, denounced as a
monopoly.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, any new mode of transit between the
two towns which offered a reasonable prospect of relief was
certain to receive a cordial welcome.&nbsp; The scheme of a
tramroad was, however, so new and comparatively untried, that it
is not surprising that the parties interested should have
hesitated before committing themselves to it.&nbsp; Mr. Sandars,
a Liverpool merchant, was amongst the first to broach the
subject.&nbsp; He had suffered in his business, in common with
many others, from the insufficiency of the existing modes of
communication, and was ready to give consideration to any plan
presenting elements of practical efficiency which proposed a
remedy for the generally admitted grievance.&nbsp; Having caused
inquiry to be made as to the success which had attended the
haulage of heavy coal-trains by locomotive power on the northern
railways, he was led to the opinion that the same means might be
equally efficient in conducting the increasing traffic in
merchandise between Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; He ventilated
the subject amongst his friends, and about the beginning of 1821
a committee was formed for the purpose of bringing the scheme of
a railroad before the public.</p>
<p>The novel project having become noised abroad, attracted the
attention of the friends of railways in other quarters.&nbsp;
Tramroads were by no means new expedients for the transit of
heavy articles.&nbsp; The Croydon and Wandsworth Railway, laid
down by William Jessop as early as the year 1801, had been
regularly used for the conveyance of lime and stone in waggons
hauled by mules or donkeys from <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Merstham to
London.&nbsp; The sight of this humble railroad in 1813 led Sir
Richard Phillips in his &lsquo;Morning Walk to Kew&rsquo; to
anticipate the great advantages which would be derived by the
nation from the general adoption of Blenkinsop&rsquo;s engine for
the conveyance of mails and passengers at ten or even fifteen
miles an hour.&nbsp; In the same year we find Mr. Lovell
Edgworth, who had for fifty years been advocating the superiority
of tram or rail roads over common roads, writing to James Watt
(7th August, 1813): &ldquo;I have always thought that steam would
become the universal lord, and that we should in time scorn
post-horses; an iron railroad would be a cheaper thing than a
road upon the common construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Gray, of Nottingham, was another speculator on the same
subject.&nbsp; Though he was no mechanic nor inventor, he had an
enthusiastic belief in the powers of the railroad system.&nbsp;
Being a native of Leeds, he had, when a boy, seen
Blenkinsop&rsquo;s locomotive at work on the Middleton cogged
railroad, and from an early period he seems to have entertained
almost as sanguine views on the subject as Sir Richard
Phillips.&nbsp; It would appear that Gray was residing in
Brussels in 1816, when the project of a canal from Charleroi, for
the purpose of connecting Holland with the mining districts of
Belgium, was the subject of discussion; and, in conversation with
Mr. John Cockerill and others, he took the opportunity of
advocating the superior advantages of a railway.&nbsp; He was
absorbed for some time with the preparation of a pamphlet on the
subject.&nbsp; He shut himself up, secluded from his wife and
relations, declining to give them any information as to his
mysterious studies, beyond the assurance that his scheme
&ldquo;would revolutionise the whole face of the material world
and of society.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1820 Mr. Gray published the
result of his studies in his &lsquo;Observations on a General
Iron Railway,&rsquo; in which, with great cogency, he urged the
superiority of a locomotive railway over common roads and canals,
pointing out, at the same time, the advantages to all classes of
<!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>the community of this mode of conveyance for
merchandise and persons.&nbsp; In this book Mr. Gray suggested a
railway between Manchester and Liverpool, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he
observed, &ldquo;would employ many thousands of the distressed
population of Lancashire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The treatise must have met
with a ready sale, as we find that two years later it had passed
into a fourth edition.&nbsp; In 1822 Mr. Gray added diagrams to
the book, showing, in one, suggested lines of railway connecting
the principal towns of England, and in another, the principal
towns of Ireland.</p>
<p>These speculations show that the subject of railways was
gradually becoming familiar to the public mind, and that
thoughtful men were anticipating with confidence the adoption of
steam-power for the purposes of railway traction.&nbsp; At the
same time, a still more profitable class of labourers was at
work&mdash;first, men like Stephenson, who were engaged in
improving the locomotive and making it a practicable and
economical working power; and next, those like Edward Pease of
Darlington, and Joseph Sandars of Liverpool, who were organising
the means of laying down the railways.&nbsp; Mr. William James,
of West Bromwich, belonged to the active class of
projectors.&nbsp; He was a man of considerable social influence,
of an active temperament, and had from an early period taken a
warm interest in the formation of tramroads.&nbsp; Acting as
land-agent for gentlemen of property in the mining districts, he
had laid down several tramroads in the neighbourhood of
Birmingham, Gloucester, and Bristol; and he published many
pamphlets urging their formation in other places.&nbsp; At one
period of his life he was a large iron-manufacturer.&nbsp; The
times, however, went against him.&nbsp; It was thought he was too
bold, some considered him even reckless, in his speculations; and
he lost almost his entire fortune.&nbsp; He continued to follow
the business of a land-agent, and it was while engaged in making
a survey for one of his clients in the neighbourhood of Liverpool
early in 1821, that he first heard of the project of a railway
between that town and Manchester.&nbsp; <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>He at once
called upon Mr. Sandars, and offered his services as surveyor of
the proposed line, and his offer was accepted.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A trial survey was then begun, but it was conducted with great
difficulty, the inhabitants of the district entertaining the most
violent prejudices against the scheme. In some places Mr. James
and his surveying party even encountered personal violence. The
farmers stationed men at the field-gates with pitchforks, and
sometimes with guns, to drive them back. At St. Helen&rsquo;s,
one of the chainmen was laid hold of by a mob of colliers, and
threatened to be hurled down a coal-pit. A number of men, women,
and children, collected and ran after the surveyors wherever they
made their appearance, bawling nicknames and throwing stones at
them. As one of the chainmen was climbing over a gate one day, a
labourer made at him with a pitchfork, and ran it through his
clothes into his back; other watchers running up, the chainman,
who was more stunned than hurt, took to his heels and fled. But
that mysterious-looking instrument&mdash;-the
theodolite-&mdash;most excited the fury of the natives, who
concentrated on the man who carried <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>it their
fiercest execrations and most offensive nicknames.</p>
<p>A powerful fellow, a noted bruiser, was hired by the surveyors
to carry the instrument, with a view to its protection against
all assailants; but one day an equally powerful fellow, a St.
Helen&rsquo;s collier, cock of the walk in his neighbourhood,
made up to the theodolite bearer to wrest it from him by sheer
force.&nbsp; A battle took place, the collier was soundly
pummelled, but the natives poured in volleys of stones upon the
surveyors and their instruments, and the theodolite was smashed
to pieces.</p>
<p>An outline-survey having at length been made, notices were
published of an intended application to Parliament.&nbsp; In the
mean time Mr. James proceeded to Killingworth to see
Stephenson&rsquo;s locomotives at work.&nbsp; Stephenson was not
at home at the time, but James saw his engines, and was very much
struck by their power and efficiency.&nbsp; He saw at a glance
the magnificent uses to which the locomotive might be
applied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is an engine
that will, before long, effect a complete revolution in
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Returning to Moreton-in-the-Marsh, he wrote
to Mr. Losh <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>(Stephenson&rsquo;s partner in the
patent) expressing his admiration of the Killingworth
engine.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the greatest
wonder of the age, and the forerunner, as I firmly believe, of
the most important changes in the internal communications of the
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly after, Mr. James, accompanied by
his two sons, made a second journey to Killingworth, where he met
both Losh and Stephenson.&nbsp; The visitors were at once taken
to where the locomotive was working, and invited to mount
it.&nbsp; The uncouth and extraordinary appearance of the
machine, as it came snorting along, was somewhat alarming to the
youths, who expressed their fears lest it should burst; and they
were with some difficulty induced to mount.</p>
<p>The engine went through its usual performances, dragging a
heavy load of coal-waggons at about six miles an hour, with
apparent ease, at which Mr. James expressed his extreme
satisfaction, and declared to Mr. Losh his opinion that
Stephenson &ldquo;was the greatest practical genius of the
age,&rdquo; and that, &ldquo;if he developed the full powers of
that engine (the locomotive), his fame in the world would rank
equal with that of Watt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. James informed
Stephenson and Losh of his survey of the proposed tramroad
between Liverpool and Manchester, and did not hesitate to state
that he would thenceforward advocate the construction of a
locomotive railroad instead of the tramroad which had originally
been proposed.</p>
<p>Stephenson and Losh were naturally desirous of enlisting
James&rsquo;s good services on behalf of their patent locomotive,
for as yet it had proved comparatively unproductive.&nbsp; They
believed that he might be able so to advocate it in influential
quarters as to ensure its more extensive adoption, and with this
object they proposed to give him an interest in the patent.&nbsp;
Accordingly they assigned him one-fourth of any profits which
might be derived from the use of the patent locomotive on any
railways constructed south of a line drawn across England from
Liverpool to Hull.&nbsp; The arrangement, however, led to no
beneficial results.&nbsp; Mr. <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>James
endeavoured to introduce the engine on the Moreton-on-Marsh
Railway; but it was opposed by the engineer of the line, and the
attempt failed.&nbsp; He next urged that a locomotive should be
sent for trial upon the Merstham tramroad; but, anxious though
Stephenson was respecting its extended employment, he was too
cautious to risk an experiment which might only bring discredit
upon the engine; and the Merstham road being only laid with
cast-iron plates, which would not bear its weight, the invitation
was declined.</p>
<p>It turned out that the first survey of the Liverpool and
Manchester line was very imperfect, and it was determined to have
a second and more complete one made in the following year.&nbsp;
Robert Stephenson was sent over by his father to Liverpool to
assist in this survey.&nbsp; He was present with Mr. James on the
occasion on which he tried to lay out the line across Chat
Moss,&mdash;a proceeding which was not only difficult but
dangerous.&nbsp; The Moss was very wet at the time, and only its
edges could be ventured on.&nbsp; Mr. James was a heavy,
thick-set man; and one day, when endeavouring to obtain a stand
for his theodolite, he felt himself suddenly sinking.&nbsp; He
immediately threw himself down, and rolled over and over until he
reached firm ground again, in a sad mess.&nbsp; Other attempts
which he subsequently made to enter upon the Moss for the same
purpose, were abandoned for the same reason&mdash;the want of a
solid stand for the theodolite.</p>
<p>On the 4th October, 1822, we find Mr. James writing to Mr.
Sandars, &ldquo;I came last night to send my aid, Robert
Stephenson, to his father, and to-morrow I shall pay off Evans
and Hamilton, two other assistants.&nbsp; I have now only Messrs.
Padley and Clarke to finish the copy of plans for Parliament,
which will be done in about a week or nine days&rsquo;
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would appear however, that, notwithstanding
all his exertions, Mr. James was unable to complete his plans and
estimates in time for the ensuing Session; and another year was
thus lost.&nbsp; The Railroad Committee <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>became
impatient at the delay.&nbsp; Mr. James&rsquo;s financial
embarrassments reached their climax; and, what with illness and
debt, he was no longer in a position to fulfil his promises to
the Committee.&nbsp; They were, therefore, under the necessity of
calling to their aid some other engineer.</p>
<p>Mr. Sandars had by this time visited George Stephenson at
Killingworth, and, like all who came within reach of his personal
influence, was charmed with him at first sight.&nbsp; The energy
which he had displayed in carrying on the works of the Stockton
and Darlington Railway, now approaching completion; his readiness
to face difficulties, and his practical ability in overcoming
them; the enthusiasm which he displayed on the subject of
railways and railway locomotion,&mdash;concurred in satisfying
Mr. Sandars that he was, of all men, the best calculated to help
forward the Liverpool undertaking at this juncture.&nbsp; On his
return he stated this opinion to the Committee, who approved his
recommendation, and George Stephenson was unanimously appointed
engineer of the projected railway.</p>
<p>It will be observed that Mr. Sandars had held to his original
purpose with great determination and perseverance, and he
gradually succeeded in enlisting on his side an increasing number
of influential merchants and manufacturers both at Liverpool and
Manchester.&nbsp; Early in 1824 he published a pamphlet, in which
he strongly urged the great losses and interruptions to the trade
of the district by the delays in the forwarding of merchandise;
and in the same year he had a Public Declaration drawn up, and
signed by upwards of 150 of the principal merchants of Liverpool,
setting forth that they considered &ldquo;the present
establishments for the transport of goods quite inadequate, and
that a new line of conveyance has become absolutely necessary to
conduct the increasing trade of the country with speed,
certainty, and economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A public meeting was then held to consider the best plan to be
adopted, and resolutions were passed in favour of a
railroad.&nbsp; A committee was appointed to take the necessary
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>measures; but, as if reluctant to enter upon their
arduous struggle with the &ldquo;vested interests,&rdquo; they
first waited on Mr. Bradshaw, the Duke of Bridgewater&rsquo;s
canal agent, in the hope of persuading him to increase the means
of conveyance, as well as to reduce the charges; but they were
met by an unqualified refusal.&nbsp; They suggested the
expediency of a railway, and invited Mr. Bradshaw to become a
proprietor of shares in it.&nbsp; But his reply
was&mdash;&ldquo;All or none!&rdquo;&nbsp; The canal proprietors,
confident in their imagined security, ridiculed the proposed
railway as a chimera.&nbsp; It had been spoken about years
before, and nothing had come of it then: it would be the same
now.</p>
<p>In order to form a better opinion as to the practicability of
the railroad, a deputation of gentlemen interested in the project
proceeded to Killingworth, to inspect the engines which had been
so long in use there.&nbsp; They first went to Darlington, where
they found the works of the Stockton line in progress, though
still unfinished.&nbsp; Proceeding next to Killingworth with Mr.
Stephenson, they there witnessed the performances of his
locomotive engines.&nbsp; The result of their visit was, on the
whole, so satisfactory, that on their report being delivered to
the committee at Liverpool, it was finally determined to form a
company of proprietors for the construction of a double line of
railway between Liverpool and Manchester.</p>
<p>The first prospectus of the scheme was dated the 29th October,
1824, and had attached to it the names of the leading merchants
of Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; It was a modest document, very
unlike the inflated balloons which were sent up by railway
speculators in succeeding years.&nbsp; It set forth as its main
object the establishment of a safe and cheap mode of transit for
merchandise, by which the conveyance of goods between the two
towns would be effected in 5 or 6 hours (instead of 36 hours by
the canal), whilst the charges would be reduced one-third.&nbsp;
On looking at the prospectus now, it is curious to note that,
while the advantages anticipated from the carriage of merchandise
<!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>were strongly insisted upon, the conveyance of
passengers&mdash;which proved to be the chief source of
profit&mdash;was only very cautiously referred to.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As a cheap and expeditious means of conveyance for
travellers,&rdquo; says the prospectus in conclusion, &ldquo;the
railway holds out the fair prospect of a public accommodation,
the magnitude and importance of which cannot be immediately
ascertained.&rdquo;&nbsp; The estimated expense of forming the
line was set down at &pound;400,000,&mdash;a sum which was
eventually found quite inadequate.&nbsp; The subscription list
when opened was filled up without difficulty.</p>
<p>While the project was still under discussion, its promoters,
desirous of removing the doubts which existed as to the
employment of steam power on the proposed railway, sent a second
deputation to Killingworth for the purpose of again observing the
action of Stephenson&rsquo;s engines.&nbsp; The cautious
projectors of the railway were not yet quite satisfied; and a
third journey was made to Killingworth, in January, 1825, by
several gentlemen of the committee, accompanied by practical
engineers, for the purpose of being personal eye-witnesses of
what steam-carriages were able to perform upon a railway.&nbsp;
There they saw a train, consisting of a locomotive and loaded
waggons, weighing in all 54 tons, travelling at the average rate
of about 7 miles an hour, the greatest speed being about
9&frac12; miles an hour.&nbsp; But when the engine was run with
only one waggon attached containing twenty gentlemen, five of
whom were engineers, the speed attained was from 10 to 12 miles
an hour.</p>
<p>In the mean time the survey was proceeded with, in the face of
great opposition from the proprietors of the lands through which
the railway was intended to pass.&nbsp; The prejudices of the
farming and labouring classes were strongly excited against the
persons employed upon the ground, and it was with the greatest
difficulty that the levels could be taken.&nbsp; At one place,
Stephenson was driven off the ground by the keepers, and
threatened to be ducked <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>in the pond
if found there again.&nbsp; The farmers also turned out their men
to watch the surveying party, and prevent them entering upon any
lands where they had the power of driving them off.</p>
<p>One of the proprietors declared that he would order his
game-keepers to shoot or apprehend any persons attempting a
survey over his property.&nbsp; But one moonlight night a survey
was obtained by the following ruse.&nbsp; Some men, under the
orders of the surveying party, were set to fire off guns in a
particular quarter; on which all the game-keepers on the watch
made off in that direction, and they were drawn away to such a
distance in pursuit of the supposed poachers, as to enable a
rapid survey to be made during their absence.</p>
<p>When the canal companies found that the Liverpool merchants
were determined to proceed with their scheme&mdash;that they had
completed their survey, and were ready to apply to Parliament for
an Act to enable them to form the railway&mdash;they at last
reluctantly, and with a bad grace, made overtures of
conciliation.&nbsp; They promised to employ steam-vessels both on
the Mersey and on the Canal.&nbsp; One of the companies offered
to reduce its length by three miles, at a considerable
outlay.&nbsp; At the same time they made a show of lowering their
rates.&nbsp; But it was too late; for the project of the railway
had now gone so far that the promoters (who might have been
conciliated by such overtures at an earlier period) felt they
were fully committed to it, and that now they could not well draw
back.&nbsp; Besides, the remedies offered by the canal companies
could only have had the effect of staving off the difficulty for
a brief season,&mdash;the absolute necessity of forming a new
line of communication between Liverpool and Manchester becoming
more urgent from year to year.&nbsp; Arrangements were therefore
made for proceeding with the bill in the parliamentary session of
1825.</p>
<p>On this becoming known, the canal companies prepared to resist
the measure tooth and nail.&nbsp; The public were <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>appealed to on the subject; pamphlets were written and
newspapers were hired to revile the railway.&nbsp; It was
declared that its formation would prevent cows grazing and hens
laying.&nbsp; The poisoned air from the locomotives would kill
birds as they flew over them, and render the preservation of
pheasants and foxes no longer possible.&nbsp; Householders
adjoining the projected line were told that their houses would be
burnt up by the fire thrown from the engine-chimneys; while the
air around would be polluted by clouds of smoke.&nbsp; There
would no longer be any use for horses; and if railways extended,
the species would become extinguished, and oats and hay be
rendered unsaleable commodities.&nbsp; Travelling by rail would
be highly dangerous, and country inns would be ruined.&nbsp;
Boilers would burst and blow passengers to atoms.&nbsp; But there
was always this consolation to wind up with&mdash;that the weight
of the locomotive would completely prevent its moving, and that
railways, even if made, could <i>never</i> be worked by
steam-power.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Mr. Stephenson, at the interviews with counsel,
held previous to the Liverpool and Manchester bill going into
Committee of the House of Commons, confidently stated his
expectation of being able to impel his locomotive at the rate of
20 miles an hour, Mr. William Brougham, who was retained by the
promoters to conduct their case, frankly told him that if he did
not moderate his views, and bring his engine within a
<i>reasonable</i> speed, he would &ldquo;inevitably damn the
whole thing, and be himself regarded as a maniac fit only for
Bedlam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea thrown out by Stephenson, of travelling at a rate of
speed double that of the fastest mail-coach, appeared at the time
so preposterous that he was unable to find any engineer who would
risk his reputation in supporting such &ldquo;absurd
views.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speaking of his isolation at the time, he
subsequently observed, at a public meeting of railway men in
Manchester: &ldquo;He remembered the time when he had very few
supporters in bringing out the railway system&mdash;<!-- page
159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>when he sought England over for an engineer to support
him in his evidence before Parliament, and could find only one
man, James Walker, but was afraid to call that gentleman, because
he knew nothing about railways.&nbsp; He had then no one to tell
his tale to but Mr. Sandars, of Liverpool, who did listen to him,
and kept his spirits up; and his schemes had at length been
carried out only by dint of sheer perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Stephenson&rsquo;s idea was at that time regarded as
but the dream of a chimerical projector.&nbsp; It stood before
the public friendless, struggling hard to gain a footing,
scarcely daring to lift itself into notice for fear of
ridicule.&nbsp; The civil engineers generally rejected the notion
of a Locomotive Railway; and when no leading man of the day could
be found to stand forward in support of the Killingworth
mechanic, its chances of success must indeed have been pronounced
but small.</p>
<p>When such was the hostility of the civil engineers, no wonder
the reviewers were puzzled.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo; in
an able article in support of the projected Liverpool and
Manchester Railway,&mdash;while admitting its absolute necessity,
and insisting that there was no choice left but a railroad, on
which the journey between Liverpool and Manchester, whether
performed by horses or engines, would always be accomplished
&ldquo;within the day,&rdquo;&mdash;nevertheless scouted the idea
of travelling at a greater speed than eight or nine miles an
hour.&nbsp; Adverting to a project for forming a railway to
Woolwich, by which passengers were to be drawn by locomotive
engines, moving with twice the velocity of ordinary coaches, the
reviewer observed:&mdash;&ldquo;What can be more palpably absurd
and ridiculous than the prospect held out of locomotives
travelling <i>twice as fast</i> as stagecoaches!&nbsp; We would
as soon expect the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be
fired off upon one of Congreve&rsquo;s ricochet rockets, as trust
themselves to the mercy of such a machine going at such a
rate.&nbsp; We will back old Father Thames against the Woolwich
Railway for any sum.&nbsp; We <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>trust that
Parliament will, in all railways it may sanction, limit the speed
to <i>eight or nine miles an hour</i>, which we entirely agree
with Mr. Sylvester is as great as can be ventured on with
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the survey was completed, the plans were deposited,
the requisite preliminary arrangements were made, and the
promoters of the scheme applied to Parliament for the necessary
powers to construct the railway.&nbsp; The Bill went into
Committee of the Commons on the 21st of March, 1825.&nbsp; There
was an extraordinary array of legal talent on the occasion, but
especially on the side of the opponents to the measure; their
counsel including Mr. (afterwards Baron) Alderson, Mr.
(afterwards Baron) Parke, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Erle.&nbsp; The
counsel for the bill were Mr. Adam, Mr. Serjeant Spankie, Mr.
William Brougham, and Mr. Joy.</p>
<p>Evidence was taken at great length as to the difficulties and
delays in forwarding raw material of all kinds from Liverpool to
Manchester, as also in the conveyance of manufactured goods from
Manchester to Liverpool.&nbsp; The evidence adduced in support of
the bill on these grounds was overwhelming.&nbsp; The utter
inadequacy of the existing modes of conveyance to carry on
satisfactorily the large and rapidly-growing trade between the
two towns was fully proved.&nbsp; But then came the gist of the
promoter&rsquo;s case&mdash;the evidence to prove the
practicability of a railroad to be worked by locomotive
power.&nbsp; Mr. Adam, in his opening speech, referred to the
cases of the Hetton and the Killingworth railroads, where heavy
goods were safely and economically transported by means of
locomotive engines.&nbsp; &ldquo;None of the tremendous
consequences,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;have ensued from the use
of steam in land carriage that have been stated.&nbsp; The horses
have not started, nor the cows ceased to give their milk, nor
have ladies miscarried at the sight of these things going forward
at the rate of four miles and a half an hour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the petition of two ladies alleging the great
danger to be apprehended <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>from the
bursting of the locomotive boilers, he urged the safety of the
high-pressure engine when the boilers were constructed of
wrought-iron; and as to the rate at which they could travel, he
expressed his full conviction that such engines &ldquo;could
supply force to drive a carriage at the rate of five or six miles
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taking of the evidence as to the impediments thrown in the
way of trade and commerce by the existing system extended over a
month, and it was the 21st of April before the Committee went
into the engineering evidence, which was the vital part of the
question.</p>
<p>On the 25th George Stephenson was called into the
witness-box.&nbsp; It was his first appearance before a Committee
of the House of Commons, and he well knew what he had to
expect.&nbsp; He was aware that the whole force of the opposition
was to be directed against him; and if they could break down his
evidence, the canal monopoly might yet be upheld for a
time.&nbsp; Many years afterwards, when looking back at his
position on this trying occasion, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;When I
went to Liverpool to plan a line from thence to Manchester, I
pledged myself to the directors to attain a speed of 10 miles an
hour.&nbsp; I said I had no doubt the locomotive might be made to
go much faster, but that we had better be moderate at the
beginning.&nbsp; The directors said I was quite right; for that
if, when they went to Parliament, I talked of going at a greater
rate than 10 miles an hour, I should put a cross upon the
concern.&nbsp; It was not an easy task for me to keep the engine
down to 10 miles an hour, but it must be done, and I did my
best.&nbsp; I had to place myself in that most unpleasant of all
positions&mdash;the witness-box of a Parliamentary
Committee.&nbsp; I was not long in it, before I began to wish for
a hole to creep out at!&nbsp; I could not find words to satisfy
either the Committee or myself.&nbsp; I was subjected to the
cross-examination of eight or ten barristers, purposely, as far
as possible, to bewilder me.&nbsp; Some member of the Committee
asked if I was a foreigner, and another hinted that I was
mad.&nbsp; But I put up with every rebuff, and <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>went on
with my plans, determined not to be put down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson stood before the Committee to prove what the
public opinion of that day held to be impossible.&nbsp; The
self-taught mechanic had to demonstrate the practicability of
accomplishing that which the most distinguished engineers of the
time regarded as impracticable.&nbsp; Clear though the subject
was to himself, and familiar as he was with the powers of the
locomotive, it was no easy task for him to bring home his
convictions, or even to convey his meaning, to the less informed
minds of his hearers.&nbsp; In his strong Northumbrian dialect,
he struggled for utterance, in the face of the sneers,
interruptions, and ridicule of the opponents of the measure, and
even of the Committee, some of whom shook their heads and
whispered doubts as to his sanity, when he energetically avowed
that he could make the locomotive go at the rate of 12 miles an
hour!&nbsp; It was so grossly in the teeth of all the experience
of honourable members, that the man &ldquo;must certainly be
labouring under a delusion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet his large experience of railways and locomotives, as
described by himself to the Committee, entitled this
&ldquo;untaught, inarticulate genius,&rdquo; as he has so well
been styled, to speak with confidence on such a subject.&nbsp;
Beginning with his experience as a brakesman at Killingworth in
1803, he went on to state that he was appointed to take the
entire charge of the steam-engines in 1813, and had superintended
the railroads connected with the numerous collieries of the Grand
Allies from that time downwards.&nbsp; He had laid down or
superintended the railways at Burradon, Mount Moor, Springwell,
Bedlington, Hetton, and Darlington, besides improving those at
Killingworth, South Moor, and Derwent Crook.&nbsp; He had
constructed fifty-five steam-engines, of which sixteen were
locomotives.&nbsp; Some of these had been sent to France.&nbsp;
The engines constructed by him for the working of the
Killingworth Railroad, eleven years before, had continued
steadily at work ever since, <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>and
fulfilled his most sanguine expectations.&nbsp; He was prepared
to prove the safety of working high-pressure locomotives on a
railroad, and the superiority of this mode of transporting goods
over all others.&nbsp; As to speed, he said he had recommended 8
miles an hour with 20 tons, and 4 miles an hour with 40 tons; but
he was quite confident that much more might be done.&nbsp;
Indeed, he had no doubt they might go at the rate of 12
miles.&nbsp; As to the charge that locomotives on a railroad
would so terrify the horses in the neighbourhood, that to travel
on horseback or to plough the adjoining fields would be rendered
highly dangerous, the witness said that horses learnt to take no
notice of them, though there <i>were</i> horses that would shy at
a wheelbarrow.&nbsp; A mail-coach was likely to be more shied at
by horses than a locomotive.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of
Killingworth, the cattle in the fields went on grazing while the
engines passed them, and the farmers made no complaints.</p>
<p>Mr. Alderson, who had carefully studied the subject, and was
well skilled in practical science, subjected the witness to a
protracted and severe cross-examination as to the speed and power
of the locomotive, the stroke of the piston, the slipping of the
wheels upon the rails, and various other points of detail.&nbsp;
Mr. Stephenson insisted that no slipping took place, as attempted
to be extorted from him by the counsel.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;It
is impossible for slipping to take place so long as the adhesive
weight of the wheel upon the rail is greater than the weight to
be dragged after it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to accidents, Stephenson
said he knew of none that had occurred with his engines.&nbsp;
There had been one, he was told, at the Middleton Colliery, near
Leeds, with a Blenkinsop engine.&nbsp; The driver had been in
liquor, and put a considerable load on the safety-valve, so that
upon going forward the engine blew up and the man was
killed.&nbsp; But he added, if proper precautions had been used
with that boiler, the accident could not have happened.&nbsp; The
following cross-examination occurred in reference to the question
of speed:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he was asked, &ldquo;when a
body is moving upon a road, the greater the velocity the greater
the momentum that is generated?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What would be the momentum
of 40 tons moving at the rate of 12 miles an hour?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be very great.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Have you seen
a railroad that would stand that?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Any
railroad that would bear going 4 miles an hour: I mean to say,
that if it would bear the weight at 4 miles an hour, it would
bear it at 12.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Taking it at 4 miles an hour,
do you mean to say that it would not require a stronger railway
to carry the same weight 12 miles an hour?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will give an answer to that.&nbsp; I dare say every person has
been over ice when skating, or seen persons go over, and they
know that it would bear them better at a greater velocity than it
would if they went slower; when they go quick, the weight in a
measure ceases.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Is not that upon the
hypothesis that the railroad is perfect?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is; and I mean to make it perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not necessary to state that to have passed the ordeal of
so severe a cross-examination scatheless, needed no small amount
of courage, intelligence, and ready shrewdness on the part of the
witness.&nbsp; Nicholas Wood, who was present on the occasion,
has since stated that the point on which Stephenson was hardest
pressed was that of speed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;that it would have lost the Company their bill if he
had gone beyond 8 or 9 miles an hour.&nbsp; If he had stated his
intention of going 12 or 15 miles an hour, not a single person
would have believed it to be practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Committee also seem to have entertained considerable alarm
as to the high rate of speed which had been spoken of, and
proceeded to examine the witness further on the subject.&nbsp;
They supposed the case of the engine being upset when going at 9
miles an hour, and asked what, in such a case, would become of
the cargo astern.&nbsp; To which the witness replied that it
would not be upset.&nbsp; One of the members of the Committee
pressed the witness a little <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>further.&nbsp; He put the following
case:&mdash;&ldquo;Suppose, now, one of these engines to be going
along a railroad at the rate of 9 or 10 miles an hour, and that a
cow were to stray upon the line and get in the way of the engine;
would not that, think you, be a very awkward
circumstance?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the
witness, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;very
awkward&mdash;<i>for the coo</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The honourable
member did not proceed further with his cross-examination; to use
a railway phrase, he was &ldquo;shunted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
asked if animals would not be very much frightened by the engine
passing them, especially by the glare of the red-hot
chimney?&nbsp; &ldquo;But how would they know that it
wasn&rsquo;t painted?&rdquo; said the witness.</p>
<p>On the following day, the engineer was subjected to a very
severe examination.&nbsp; On that part of the scheme with which
he was most practically conversant, his evidence was clear and
conclusive.&nbsp; Now, he had to give evidence on the plans made
by his surveyors, and the estimates which had been founded on
such plans.&nbsp; So long as he was confined to locomotive
engines and iron railroads, with the minutest details of which he
was more familiar than any man living, he felt at home, and in
his element.&nbsp; But when the designs of bridges and the cost
of constructing them had to be gone into, the subject being in a
great measure new to him, his evidence was much less
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Mr. Alderson cross-examined him at great length on the plans
of the bridges, the tunnels, the crossings of the roads and
streets, and the details of the survey, which, it soon clearly
appeared, were in some respects seriously at fault.&nbsp; It
seems that, after the plans had been deposited, Stephenson found
that a much more favourable line might be made; and he made his
estimates accordingly, supposing that Parliament would not
confine the Company to the precise plan which had been
deposited.&nbsp; This was felt to be a serious blot in the
parliamentary case, and one very difficult to be got over.</p>
<p>For three entire days was our engineer subjected to <!-- page
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>this cross-examination.&nbsp; He held his ground
bravely, and defended the plans and estimates with remarkable
ability and skill; but it was clear they were imperfect, and the
result was on the whole damaging to the measure.</p>
<p>The case of the opponents was next gone into, in the course of
which the counsel indulged in strong vituperation against the
witnesses for the bill.&nbsp; One of them spoke of the utter
impossiblity of making a railway upon so treacherous a material
as Chat Moss, which was declared to be an immense mass of pulp,
and nothing else.&nbsp; &ldquo;It actually,&rdquo; said Mr.
Harrison, &ldquo;rises in height, from the rain swelling it like
a sponge, and sinks again in dry weather; and if a boring
instrument is put into it, it sinks immediately by its own
weight.&nbsp; The making of an embankment out of this pulpy, wet
moss, is no very easy task.&nbsp; Who but Mr. Stephenson would
have thought of entering into Chat Moss, carrying it out almost
like wet dung?&nbsp; It is ignorance almost inconceivable.&nbsp;
It is perfect madness, in a person called upon to speak on a
scientific subject, to propose such a plan.&nbsp; Every part of
this scheme shows that this man has applied himself to a subject
of which he has no knowledge, and to which he has no science to
apply.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then adverting to the proposal to work the
intended line by means of locomotives, the learned gentleman
proceeded: &ldquo;When we set out with the original prospectus,
we were to gallop, I know not at what rate; I believe it was at
the rate of 12 miles an hour.&nbsp; My learned friend, Mr. Adam,
contemplated&mdash;possibly alluding to Ireland&mdash;that some
of the Irish members would arrive in the waggons to a
division.&nbsp; My learned friend says that they would go at the
rate of 12 miles an hour with the aid of the devil in the form of
a locomotive, sitting as postilion on the fore horse, and an
honourable member sitting behind him to stir up the fire, and
keep it at full speed.&nbsp; But the speed at which these
locomotive engines are to go has slackened: Mr. Adam does not go
faster now than 5 miles an hour.&nbsp; The learned serjeant
(Spankie) says he should like to have 7, but he <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>would be content to go 6.&nbsp; I will show he cannot
go 6; and probably, for any practical purposes, I may be able to
show that I can keep up with him <i>by the canal</i>. . . .&nbsp;
Locomotive engines are liable to be operated upon by the
weather.&nbsp; You are told they are affected by rain, and an
attempt has been made to cover them; but the wind will affect
them; and any gale of wind which would affect the traffic on the
Mersey would render it <i>impossible</i> to set off a locomotive
engine, either by poking of the fire, or keeping up the pressure
of the steam till the boiler was ready to burst.&rdquo;&nbsp; How
amusing it now is to read these extraordinary views as to the
formation of a railway over Chat Moss, and the impossibility of
starting a locomotive engine in the face of a gale of wind!</p>
<p>Evidence was called to show that the house property passed by
the proposed railway would be greatly deteriorated&mdash;in some
places almost destroyed; that the locomotive engines would be
terrible nuisances, in consequence of the fire and smoke vomited
forth by them; and that the value of land in the neighbourhood of
Manchester alone would be deteriorated by no less than
&pound;20,000!&nbsp; Evidence was also given at great length
showing the utter impossibility of forming a road of any kind
upon Chat Moss.&nbsp; A Manchester builder, who was examined,
could not imagine the feat possible, unless by arching it across
in the manner of a viaduct from one side to the other.&nbsp; It
was the old story of &ldquo;nothing like leather.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the opposition mainly relied upon the evidence of the leading
engineers&mdash;not like Stephenson, self-taught men, but regular
professionals.&nbsp; One of these, Mr. Francis Giles, C.E., had
been twenty-two years an engineer, and could speak with some
authority.&nbsp; His testimony was mainly directed to the utter
impossibility of forming a railway over Chat Moss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>No engineer in his senses</i>,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;would go through Chat Moss if he wanted to make a railroad
from Liverpool to Manchester. . . .&nbsp; In my judgment <i>a
railroad certainly cannot be safely made over Chat Moss without
going to the bottom </i><!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span><i>of the
Moss</i>.&nbsp; The soil ought all to be taken out, undoubtedly;
in doing which, it will not be practicable to approach each end
of the cutting, as you make it, with the carriages.&nbsp; No
carriages would stand upon the Moss short of the bottom.&nbsp; My
estimate for the whole cutting and embankment over Chat Moss is
&pound;270,000 nearly, at those quantities and those prices which
are decidedly correct . . . It will be necessary to take this
Moss completely out at the bottom, in order to make a solid
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the engineers had given their evidence, Mr. Alderson
summed up in a speech which extended over two days.&nbsp; He
declared Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s plan to be &ldquo;the most absurd
scheme that ever entered into the head of man to conceive.&nbsp;
My learned friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;almost endeavoured to
stop my examination; they wished me to put in the plan, but I had
rather have the exhibition of Mr. Stephenson in that box.&nbsp; I
say he never had a plan&mdash;I believe he never had one&mdash;I
do not believe he is capable of making one.&nbsp; His is a mind
perpetually fluctuating between opposite difficulties: he neither
knows whether he is to make bridges over roads or rivers, of one
size or of another; or to make embankments, or cuttings, or
inclined planes, or in what way the thing is to be carried into
effect.&nbsp; Whenever a difficulty is pressed, as in the case of
a tunnel, he gets out of it at one end, and when you try to catch
him at that, he gets out at the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Alderson
proceeded to declaim against the gross ignorance of this
so-called engineer, who proposed to make &ldquo;impossible
ditches by the side of an impossible railway&rdquo; upon Chat
Moss; &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether Mr. Giles
is right or wrong in his estimate, for whether it be effected by
means of piers raised up all the way for four miles through Chat
Moss, whether they are to support it on beams of wood or by
erecting masonry, or whether Mr. Giles shall put a solid bank of
earth through it,&mdash;in all these schemes there is not one
found like that of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s, namely, to cut
impossible drains on the side of this road; and it is sufficient
for me <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>to suggest and to show, that this
scheme of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s is impossible or impracticable,
and that no other scheme, if they proceed upon this line, can be
suggested which will not produce enormous expense.&nbsp; I think
that has been irrefragably made out.&nbsp; Every one knows Chat
Moss&mdash;every one knows that the iron sinks immediately on its
being put upon the surface.&nbsp; I have heard of culverts, which
have been put upon the Moss, which, after having been surveyed
the day before, have the next morning disappeared; and that a
house (a poet&rsquo;s house, who may be supposed in the habit of
building castles even in the air), story after story, as fast as
one is added, the lower one sinks!&nbsp; There is nothing, it
appears, except long sedgy grass, and a little soil to prevent
its sinking into the shades of eternal night.&nbsp; I have now
done, sir, with Chat Moss, and there I leave this
railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case of the principal petitioners against the bill
occupied many more days, and on its conclusion the committee
proceeded to divide on the preamble, which was carried by a
majority of only <i>one</i>&mdash;37 voting for it, and 36
against it.&nbsp; The clauses were next considered, and on a
division the first clause, empowering the Company to make the
railway, was lost by a majority of 19 to 13.&nbsp; In like
manner, the next clause, empowering the Company to take land, was
lost; on which the bill was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Thus ended this memorable contest, which had extended over two
months&mdash;carried on throughout with great pertinacity and
skill, especially on the part of the opposition, who left no
stone unturned to defeat the measure.&nbsp; The want of a third
line of communication between Liverpool and Manchester had been
clearly proved; but the engineering evidence in support of the
proposed railway having been thrown almost entirely upon
Stephenson, who fought this, the most important part of the
battle, single-handed, was not brought out so clearly as it would
have been, had he secured more efficient engineering
assistance&mdash;which he was not able to do, as the principal
engineers of that day <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>were against the locomotive
railway.&nbsp; The obstacles thrown in the way of the survey by
the landowners and canal companies, by which the plans were
rendered exceedingly imperfect, also tended in a great measure to
defeat the bill.</p>
<p>The rejection of the bill was probably the most severe trial
George Stephenson underwent in the whole course of his
life.&nbsp; The circumstances connected with the defeat of the
measure, the errors in the levels, his rigid cross-examination,
followed by the fact of his being superseded by another engineer,
all told fearfully upon him, and for some time he was as much
weighed down as if a personal calamity of the most serious kind
had befallen him.</p>
<p>Stephenson had been so terribly abused by the leading counsel
for the opposition in the course of the proceedings before the
Committee&mdash;stigmatised by them as an ignoramus, a fool, and
a maniac&mdash;that even his friends seem for a time to have lost
faith in him and in the locomotive system, whose efficiency he
nevertheless continued to uphold.&nbsp; Things never looked
blacker for the success of the railway system than at the close
of this great parliamentary struggle.&nbsp; And yet it was on the
very eve of its triumph.</p>
<p>The Committee of Directors appointed to watch the measure in
Parliament were so determined to press on the project of a
railway, even though it should have to be worked merely by
horse-power, that the bill had scarcely been thrown out ere they
met in London to consider their next step.&nbsp; They called
their parliamentary friends together to consult as to future
proceedings; and the result was that they went back to Liverpool
determined to renew their application to Parliament in the
ensuing session.</p>
<p>It was not considered desirable to employ Mr. Stephenson in
making the new survey.&nbsp; He had not as yet established his
reputation as an engineer beyond the boundaries of his own
district; and the promoters of the bill had doubtless felt the
disadvantages of this in the course of their parliamentary
struggle.&nbsp; They therefore resolved now to employ <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>engineers of the highest established reputation, as
well as the best surveyors that could be obtained.&nbsp; In
accordance with these views they engaged Messrs. George and John
Rennie to be the engineers of the railway; and Mr. Charles
Vignolles was appointed to prepare the plans and sections.&nbsp;
The line which was eventually adopted differed somewhat from that
surveyed by Mr. Stephenson.&nbsp; The principal parks and
game-preserves of the district were carefully avoided.&nbsp; The
promoters thus hoped to get rid of the opposition of the most
influential of the resident landowners.&nbsp; The crossing of
certain of the streets of Liverpool was also avoided, and the
entrance contrived by means of a tunnel and an inclined
plane.&nbsp; The new line stopped short of the river Irwell at
the Manchester end, by which the objections grounded on an
illegal interruption to the canal or river traffic were in some
measure removed.&nbsp; The opposition of the Duke of
Bridgewater&rsquo;s trustees was also got rid of, and the Marquis
of Stafford became a subscriber for a thousand shares.&nbsp; With
reference to the use of the locomotive engine, the promoters,
remembering with what effect the objections to it had been urged
by the opponents of the bill, intimated, in their second
prospectus, that &ldquo;as a guarantee of their good faith
towards the public they will not require any clause empowering
them to use it; or they will submit to such restrictions in the
employment of it as Parliament may impose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The survey of the new line having been completed, the plans
were deposited, the standing orders duly complied with, and the
bill went before Parliament.&nbsp; The same counsel appeared for
the promoters, but the examination of witnesses was not nearly so
protracted as on the previous occasion.&nbsp; The preamble was
declared proved by a majority of 43 to 18.&nbsp; On the third
reading in the House of Commons, an animated, and what now
appears a very amusing discussion took place.&nbsp; The Hon.
Edward Stanley moved that the bill be read that day six months;
and in his speech he undertook to prove that the railway trains
would take <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span><i>ten hours</i> on the journey, and
that they could only be worked by horses.&nbsp; Sir Isaac Coffin
seconded the motion, and in doing so denounced the project as a
most flagrant imposition.&nbsp; He would not consent to see
widows&rsquo; premises invaded; and &ldquo;What, he would like to
know, was to be done with all those who had advanced money in
making and repairing turnpike-roads?&nbsp; What was to become of
coach-makers and harness-makers, coach-masters and coachmen,
inn-keepers, horse-breeders, and horse-dealers?&nbsp; Was the
house aware of the smoke and the noise, the hiss and the whirl,
which locomotive engines, passing at the rate of 10 or 12 miles
an hour, would occasion?&nbsp; Neither the cattle ploughing in
the fields or grazing in the meadows could behold them without
dismay.&nbsp; Iron would be raised in price 100 per cent., or
more probably exhausted altogether!&nbsp; It would be the
greatest nuisance, the most complete disturbance of quiet and
comfort in all parts of the kingdom, that the ingenuity of man
could invent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Huskisson and other speakers, though unable to reply to
such arguments as these, strongly supported the bill; and it was
carried on the third reading by a majority of 88 to 41.&nbsp; The
bill passed the House of Lords almost unanimously, its only
opponents being the Earl of Derby and his relative the Earl of
Wilton.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chat Moss</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Construction of the Railway</span>.</h2>
<p>The appointment of principal engineer to the railway was taken
into consideration at the first meeting of the directors held at
Liverpool subsequent to the passing of the Act.&nbsp; The
magnitude of the proposed works, and the vast consequences
involved in their experiment, were deeply impressed upon their
minds; and they resolved to secure the services of a resident
engineer of proved experience and ability.&nbsp; Their attention
was naturally directed to Mr. Stephenson; at the same time they
desired to have the benefit of the Messrs. Rennie&rsquo;s
professional assistance in superintending the works.&nbsp; Mr.
George Rennie had an interview with the Board on the subject, at
which he proposed to undertake the chief superintendence, making
six visits in each year, and stipulating that he should have the
appointment of the resident engineer.&nbsp; But the
responsibility attaching to the direction in the matter of the
efficient carrying on of the works, would not admit of their
being influenced by ordinary punctilios on the occasion; and they
accordingly declined this proposal, and proceeded to appoint Mr.
Stephenson their principal engineer at a salary of &pound;1000
per annum.</p>
<p>He at once removed his residence to Liverpool, and made
arrangements to commence the works.&nbsp; He began with the
&ldquo;impossible thing&rdquo;&mdash;to do that which the most
distinguished engineers of the day had declared that &ldquo;no
man in his senses would undertake to do&rdquo;&mdash;namely, to
make the road over Chat Moss!&nbsp; It was indeed a most
formidable undertaking; and the project of carrying a railway
along, under, or over such a material as that of which it
consisted, <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>would certainly never have occurred
to an ordinary mind.&nbsp; Michael Drayton supposed the Moss to
have had its origin at the Deluge.&nbsp; Nothing more impassable
could have been imagined than that dreary waste; and Mr. Giles
only spoke the popular feeling of the day when he declared that
no carriage could stand on it &ldquo;short of the
bottom.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this bog, singular to say, Mr. Roscoe,
the accomplished historian of the Medicis, buried his fortune in
the hopeless attempt to cultivate a portion of it which he had
bought.</p>
<p>Chat Moss is an immense peat bog of about twelve square miles
in extent.&nbsp; Unlike the bogs or swamps of Cambridge and
Lincolnshire, which consist principally of soft mud or silt, this
bog is a vast mass of spongy vegetable pulp, the result of the
growth and decay of ages.&nbsp; The spagni, or bog-mosses, cover
the entire area; one year&rsquo;s growth rising over
another,&mdash;the older growths not entirely decaying, but
remaining partially preserved by the antiseptic properties
peculiar to peat.&nbsp; Hence the remarkable fact that, although
a semifluid mass, the surface of Chat Moss rises above the level
of the surrounding country.&nbsp; Like a turtle&rsquo;s back, it
declines from the summit in every direction, having from thirty
to forty feet gradual slope to the solid land on all sides.&nbsp;
From the remains of trees, chiefly alder and birch, which have
been dug out of it, and which must have previously flourished
upon the surface of soil now deeply submerged, it is probable
that the sand and clay base on which the bog rests is
saucer-shaped, and so retains the entire mass in position.&nbsp;
In rainy weather, such is its capacity for water that it sensibly
swells, and rises in those parts where the moss is the
deepest.&nbsp; This occurs through the capillary attraction of
the fibres of the submerged moss, which is from 20 to 30 feet in
depth, whilst the growing plants effectually check evaporation
from the surface.&nbsp; This peculiar character of the Moss has
presented an insuperable difficulty in the way of reclaiming it
by any system of extensive drainage&mdash;such as by sinking
shafts, and pumping up the water by steam power, as has been
proposed.&nbsp; <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Supposing a shaft of 30 feet deep to
be sunk, it has been calculated that this would only be effectual
for draining a circle of about 100 yards, the water running down
an incline of about 5 to 1; for it was found in the course of
draining the bog, that a ditch 3 feet deep only served to drain a
space of less than 5 yards on each side, and two ditches of this
depth, 10 yards apart, left a portion of the Moss between them
scarcely affected by the drains.</p>
<p>The three resident engineers selected by Mr. Stephenson to
superintend the construction of the line, were Joseph Locke,
William Allcard, and John Dixon.&nbsp; The last was appointed to
that portion which lay across the Moss, neither of the other two
envying his lot.&nbsp; On Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s arrival, about July,
1826, Mr. Locke proceeded to show him over the length he was to
take charge of, and to instal him in office.&nbsp; When they
reached Chat Moss, Mr. Dixon found that the line had already been
staked out and the levels taken in detail by the aid of planks
laid upon the bog.&nbsp; The cutting of the drains along each
side of the proposed road had also been commenced; but the soft
pulpy stuff had up to this time flowed into the drains and filled
them up as fast as they were cut.&nbsp; Proceeding across the
Moss, on the first day&rsquo;s inspection, the new resident, when
about halfway over, slipped off the plank on which he walked, and
sank to his knees in the bog.&nbsp; Struggling only sent him the
deeper, and he might have disappeared altogether, but for the
workmen, who hastened to his assistance upon planks, and rescued
him from his perilous position.&nbsp; Much disheartened, he
desired to return, and even thought of giving up the job; but Mr.
Locke assured him that the worst part was now past; so the new
resident plucked up heart again, and both floundered on until
they reached the further edge of the Moss, wet and plastered over
with bog-sludge.&nbsp; Mr. Dixon&rsquo;s companions endeavoured
to comfort him by the assurance that he might avoid similar
perils, by walking upon &ldquo;pattens,&rdquo; or boards fastened
to the soles of his feet, as they had done when taking the
levels, and as <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>the workmen did when engaged in
making drains in the softest parts of the Moss.&nbsp; The
resident engineer was sorely puzzled in the outset by the problem
of constructing a road for heavy locomotives, with trains of
passengers and goods, upon a bog which he had found incapable of
supporting his own weight!</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s idea was, that such a road might be
made to <i>float</i> upon the bog, simply by means of a
sufficient extension of the bearing surface.&nbsp; As a ship, or
a raft, capable of sustaining heavy loads floated in water, so in
his opinion, might a light road be floated upon a bog, which was
of considerably greater consistency than water.&nbsp; Long before
the railway was thought of, Mr. Roscoe had adopted the remarkable
expedient of fitting his plough-horses with flat wooden soles or
pattens, to enable them to walk upon the Moss land which he had
brought into cultivation.&nbsp; These pattens were fitted on by
means of a screw apparatus, which met in front of the foot and
was easily fastened.&nbsp; The mode by which these pattens served
to sustain the horse is capable of easy explanation, and it will
be observed that the <i>rationale</i> likewise explains the
floating of a railway train.&nbsp; The foot of an ordinary
farm-horse presents a base of about five inches diameter, but if
this base be enlarged to seven inches&mdash;the circles being to
each other as the squares of the diameters&mdash;it will be found
that, by this slight enlargement of the base, a circle of nearly
double the area has been secured; and consequently the pressure
of the foot upon every unit of ground upon which the horse stands
has been reduced one half.&nbsp; In fact, this contrivance has an
effect tantamount to setting the horse upon eight feet instead of
four.</p>
<p>Apply the same reasoning to the ponderous locomotive, and it
will be found, that even such a machine may be made to stand upon
a bog, by means of a similar extension of the bearing
surface.&nbsp; Suppose the engine to be 20 feet long and 5 feet
wide, thus covering a surface of 100 square feet, and, provided
the bearing has been extended by means of <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>cross
sleepers supported on a matting of heath and branches of trees
covered with a few inches of gravel, the pressure of an engine of
20 tons will be only equal to about 3 pounds per inch over the
whole surface on which it stands.&nbsp; Such was George
Stephenson&rsquo;s idea in contriving his floating
road&mdash;something like an elongated raft across the Moss; and
we shall see that he steadily kept it in view in carrying the
work into execution.</p>
<p>The first thing done was to form a footpath of ling or heather
along the proposed road, on which a man might walk without risk
of sinking.&nbsp; A single line of temporary railway was then
laid down, formed of ordinary cross-bars about 3 feet long and an
inch square, with holes punched through them at the ends and
nailed down to temporary sleepers.&nbsp; Along this way ran the
waggons in which were conveyed the materials requisite to form
the permanent road.&nbsp; These waggons carried about a ton each,
and they were propelled by boys running behind them along the
narrow iron rails.&nbsp; The boys became so expert that they
would run the 4 miles across at the rate of 7 or 8 miles an hour
without missing a step; if they had done so, they would have sunk
in many places up to their middle.&nbsp; A comparatively slight
extension of the bearing surface being found sufficient to enable
the bog to bear this temporary line, the circumstance was a
source of increased confidence and hope to our engineer in
proceeding with the formation of the permanent roadway
alongside.</p>
<p>The digging of drains had been proceeding for some time along
each side of the intended line; but they filled up almost as soon
as dug, the sides flowing in, and the bottom rising up.&nbsp; It
was only in some of the drier parts of the bog that a depth of
three or four feet could be reached.&nbsp; The surface-ground
between the drains, containing the intertwined roots of heather
and long grass, was left untouched, and upon this was spread
branches of trees and hedge-cuttings.&nbsp; In the softest
places, rude gates or hurdles, some 8 or 9 feet long by 4 feet
wide, interwoven with <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>heather, were laid in double
thicknesses, their ends overlapping each other; and upon this
floating bed was spread a thin layer of gravel, on which the
sleepers, chairs, and rails were laid in the usual manner.&nbsp;
Such was the mode in which the road was formed upon the Moss.</p>
<p>It was found, however, after the permanent way had been thus
laid, that there was a tendency to sinking at those parts where
the bog was softest.&nbsp; In ordinary cases, where a bank
subsides, the sleepers are packed up with ballast or gravel; but
in this case the ballast was dug away and removed in order to
lighten the road, and the sleepers were packed instead with cakes
of dry turf or bundles of heath.&nbsp; By these expedients the
subsided parts were again floated up to the level, and an
approach was made towards a satisfactory road.&nbsp; But the most
formidable difficulties were encountered at the centre and
towards the edges of the Moss; and it required no small degree of
ingenuity and perseverance on the part of the engineer
successfully to overcome them.</p>
<p>The Moss, as already observed, was highest in the centre, and
it there presented a sort of hunchback with a rising and falling
gradient.&nbsp; At that point it was found necessary to cut
deeper drains in order to consolidate the ground between them on
which the road was to be formed.&nbsp; But, as at other places,
the deeper the cutting the more rapid was the flow of fluid bog
into the drain, the bottom rising up almost as fast as it was
removed.&nbsp; To meet this emergency, numbers of empty
tar-barrels were brought from Liverpool; and as soon as a few
yards of drain were dug, the barrels were laid down end to end,
firmly fixed to each other by strong slabs laid over the joints,
and nailed.&nbsp; They were then covered over with clay, and thus
formed an underground sewer of wood instead of bricks.&nbsp; This
expedient was found to answer the purpose intended, and the road
across the centre of the Moss having been so prepared, it was
then laid with the permanent materials.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty was, however, experienced in forming
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>an embankment upon the edge of the bog at the
Manchester end.&nbsp; Moss as dry as it could be cut, was brought
up in small waggons, by men and boys, and emptied so as to form
an embankment; but the bank had scarcely been raised three or
four feet in height, when the stuff broke through the heathery
surface of the bog and sank out of sight.&nbsp; More moss was
brought up and emptied with no better result; and for weeks the
filling was continued without any visible embankment having been
made.&nbsp; It was the duty of the resident engineer to proceed
to Liverpool every fortnight to obtain the wages for the workmen
employed under him; and on these occasions he was required to
colour up, on a section drawn to a working scale suspended
against the wall of the directors&rsquo; room, the amount of
excavation and embankment from time to time executed.&nbsp; But
on many of these occasions, Mr. Dixon had no progress whatever to
show for the money expended on the Chat Moss embankment.&nbsp;
Sometimes, indeed, the visible work done was <i>less</i> than it
had appeared a fortnight or a month before!</p>
<p>The directors now became seriously alarmed, and feared that
the evil prognostications of the eminent engineers were about to
be fulfilled.&nbsp; The resident engineer was even called upon to
supply an estimate of the cost of forming an embankment of solid
stuff throughout, as also of the cost of piling the roadway, and
in effect constructing a four mile viaduct of timber across the
Moss, from twenty to thirty feet high from the foundation.&nbsp;
The expense appalled the directors, and the question arose,
whether the work was to be proceeded with or
<i>abandoned</i>!</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson afterwards described the alarming position of
affairs at a public dinner at Birmingham (23rd December, 1837),
on the occasion of a piece of plate being presented to his son,
upon the completion of the London and Birmingham Railway.&nbsp;
He related the anecdote, he said, for the purpose of impressing
upon the minds of those who heard him the necessity of
perseverance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After working for weeks and weeks,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;in filling <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>in materials to form the road, there
did not yet appear to be the least sign of our being able to
raise the solid embankment one single inch; in short we went on
filling in without the slightest apparent effect.&nbsp; Even my
assistants began to feel uneasy, and to doubt of the success of
the scheme.&nbsp; The directors, too, spoke of it as a hopeless
task: and at length they became seriously alarmed, so much so,
indeed, that a board meeting was held on Chat Moss to decide
whether I should proceed any further.&nbsp; They had previously
taken the opinion of other engineers, who reported
unfavourably.&nbsp; There was no help for it, however, but to go
on.&nbsp; An immense outlay had been incurred; and great loss
would have been occasioned had the scheme been then abandoned,
and the line taken by another route.&nbsp; So the directors were
<i>compelled</i> to allow me to go on with my plans, of the
ultimate success of which I myself never for one moment
doubted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the progress of this part of the works, the Worsley and
Trafford men, who lived near the Moss, and plumed themselves upon
their practical knowledge of bog-work, declared the completion of
the road to be utterly impracticable.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you knew as
much about Chat Moss as we do,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you would
never have entered on so rash an undertaking; and depend upon it,
all you have done and are doing will prove abortive.&nbsp; You
must give up the idea of a floating railway, and either fill the
Moss hard from the bottom, or deviate so as to avoid it
altogether.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were the conclusions of science and
experience.</p>
<p>In the midst of all these alarms and prophecies of failure,
Stephenson never lost heart, but held to his purpose.&nbsp; His
motto was &ldquo;Persevere!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You must go on
filling in,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is no other help for
it.&nbsp; The stuff emptied in is doing its work out of sight,
and if you will but have patience, it will soon begin to
show.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the filling in went on; several
hundreds of men and boys were employed to skin the Moss all round
for many thousand yards, by means of sharp spades, called by the
turf cutters &ldquo;tommy-spades;&rdquo; <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>and the
dried cakes of turf were afterwards used to form the embankment,
until at length as the stuff sank and rested upon the bottom, the
bank gradually rose above the surface, and slowly advanced
onwards, declining in height and consequently in weight, until it
became joined to the floating road already laid upon the
Moss.&nbsp; In the course of forming the embankment, the pressure
of the bog turf tipped out of the waggons caused a copious stream
of bog-water to flow from the end of it, in colour resembling
Barclay&rsquo;s double stout; and when completed, the bank looked
like a long ridge of tightly pressed tobacco-leaf.&nbsp; The
compression of the turf may be imagined from the fact that
670,000 cubic yards of raw moss formed only 277,000 cubic yards
of embankment at the completion of the work.</p>
<p>At the western, or Liverpool end of the Chat Moss, there was a
like embankment; but, as the ground there was solid, little
difficulty was experienced in forming it, beyond the loss of
substance caused by the oozing out of the water held by the
moss-earth.</p>
<p>At another part of the Liverpool and Manchester line, Parr
Moss was crossed by an embankment about 1&frac12; mile in
extent.&nbsp; In the immediate neighbourhood was found a large
excess of cutting, which it would have been necessary to
&ldquo;put out in spoil-banks&rdquo; (according to the technical
phrase); but the surplus clay, stone, and shale, were tipped,
waggon after waggon, into Parr Moss, until a solid but concealed
embankment, from fifteen to twenty-five feet high, was formed,
although to the eye it appears to be laid upon the level of the
adjoining surface, as at Chat Moss.</p>
<p>The road across Chat Moss was finished by the 1st January,
1830, when the first experimental train of passengers passed over
it, drawn by the &ldquo;Rocket;&rdquo; and it turned out that,
instead of being the most expensive part of the line, it was
about the cheapest.&nbsp; The total cost of forming the line over
the Moss was &pound;28,000, whereas Mr. Giles&rsquo;s estimate
was &pound;270,000!&nbsp; It also proved to be one of the best
portions <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>of the railway.&nbsp; Being a
floating road, it was smooth and easy to run upon, just as Dr.
Arnott&rsquo;s water-bed is soft and easy to lie upon&mdash;the
pressure being equal at all points.&nbsp; There was, and still
is, a sort of springiness in the road over the Moss, such as is
felt in passing along a suspended bridge; and those who looked
along the line as a train passed over it, said they could observe
a waviness, such as precedes and follows a skater upon ice.</p>
<p>During the progress of these works the most ridiculous rumours
were set afloat.&nbsp; The drivers of the stage-coaches who
feared for their calling, brought the alarming intelligence into
Manchester from time to time, that &ldquo;Chat Moss was blown
up!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hundreds of men and horses had sunk; and
the works were completely abandoned!&rdquo;&nbsp; The engineer
himself was declared to have been swallowed up in the Serbonian
bog; and &ldquo;railways were at an end for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the construction of the railway, Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s
capacity for organising and directing the labours of a large
number of workmen of all kinds eminently displayed itself.&nbsp;
A vast quantity of ballast-waggons had to be constructed, and
implements and materials collected, before the army of necessary
labourers could be efficiently employed at the various points of
the line.&nbsp; There were not at that time, as there are now,
large contractors possessed of railway plant, capable of
executing earth-works on a large scale.&nbsp; The first railway
engineer had not only to contrive the plant, but to organise and
direct the labour.&nbsp; The labourers themselves had to be
trained to their work; and it was on the Liverpool and Manchester
line that Mr. Stephenson organised the staff of that mighty band
of railway navvies, whose handiworks will be the wonder and
admiration of succeeding generations.&nbsp; Looking at their
gigantic traces, the men of some future age may be found to
declare of the engineer and of his workmen, that &ldquo;there
were giants in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the works of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway are
of a much less formidable character than those <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of many
lines that have since been constructed, they were then regarded
as of the most stupendous description.&nbsp; In deed, the like of
them had not before been executed in England.&nbsp; It had been
our engineer&rsquo;s original intention carry the railway from
the north end of Liverpool, round the red-sandstone ridge on
which the upper part of the town is built, and also round the
higher rise of the coal formation at Rainhill, by following the
natural levels.&nbsp; But the opposition of the landowners having
forced the line more to the south, it was rendered necessary to
cut through the hills, and go over the high grounds instead of
round them.&nbsp; The first consequence of this alteration in the
plans was the necessity for constructing a tunnel under the town
of Liverpool 1&frac12; mile in length; the second, a long and
deep cutting through the red-sandstone rock at Olive Mount; and
the third and most serious of all, was the necessity for
surmounting the Whiston and Sutton hills by inclined planes of 1
in 96.&nbsp; The line was also, by the same forced deviation,
prevented passing through the Lancashire coal-field, and the
engineer was compelled to carry it across the Sankey valley, at a
point where the waters of the brook had dug out an excessively
deep channel through the marl-beds of the district.</p>
<p>The principal difficulty was experienced in pushing on the
works connected with the formation of the tunnel under Liverpool,
2200 yards in length.&nbsp; The blasting and hewing of the rock
were vigorously carried on night and day; and the
engineer&rsquo;s practical experience in the collieries here
proved of great use to him.&nbsp; Many obstacles had to be
encountered and overcome in the formation of the tunnel, the rock
varying in hardness and texture at different parts.&nbsp; In some
places the miners were deluged by water, which surged from the
soft blue shale found at the lowest level of the tunnel.&nbsp; In
other places, beds of wet sand were cut through; and there
careful propping and pinning were necessary to prevent the roof
from tumbling in, until the masonry to support it could be
erected.&nbsp; On one occasion, <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>while the
engineer was absent from Liverpool, a mass of loose moss-earth
and sand fell from the roof, which had been insufficiently
propped.&nbsp; The miners withdrew from the work; and on
Stephenson&rsquo;s return, he found them in a refractory state,
refusing to re-enter the tunnel.&nbsp; He induced them, however,
by his example, to return to their labours; and when the roof had
been secured, the work went on again as before.&nbsp; When there
was danger, he was <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>always ready to share it with the
men; and gathering confidence from his fearlessness, they
proceeded vigorously with the undertaking, boring and mining
their way towards the light.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p184.jpg">
<img alt=
"Olive Mount Cutting"

"Olive Mount Cutting"

</a></p>
<p>The Olive Mount cutting was the first extensive stone cutting
executed on any railway, and to this day it is one of the most
formidable.&nbsp; It is about two miles long, and in some parts
80 feet deep.&nbsp; It is a narrow ravine or defile cut out of
the solid rock; and not less than 480,000 cubic yards of stone
were removed from it.&nbsp; Mr. Vignolles, afterwards describing
it, said it looked as if it had been dug out by giants.</p>
<p>The crossing of so many roads and streams involved the
necessity for constructing an unusual number of bridges.&nbsp;
There were not fewer than 63, under or over the railway, on the
30 miles between Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; Up to this time,
bridges had been applied generally to high roads where inclined
approaches were of comparatively small importance, and in
determining the rise of his arch the engineer selected any
headway he thought proper.&nbsp; Every consideration was indeed
made subsidiary to constructing the bridge itself, and the
completion of one large structure of this sort was regarded as an
epoch in engineering history.&nbsp; Yet here, in the course of a
few years, no fewer than 63 bridges were constructed on one line
of railway!&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson early found that the ordinary
arch was inapplicable in certain cases, where the headway was
limited, and yet the level of the railway must be
preserved.&nbsp; In such cases he employed simple cast-iron
beams, by which he safely bridged gaps of moderate width,
economizing headway, and introducing the use of a new material of
the greatest possible value to the railway engineer.&nbsp; The
bridges of masonry upon the line were of many kinds; several of
them askew bridges, and others, such as those at Newton and over
the Irwell at Manchester, straight and of considerable
dimensions; but the principal piece of masonry was the Sankey
viaduct.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>
<a href="images/p186.jpg">
<img alt=
"Sankey Viaduct"
title=
"Sankey Viaduct"
src="images/p186.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This fine work is principally of brick, with stone
facings.&nbsp; It consists of nine arches of fifty feet span
each.&nbsp; The massive piers are supported on two hundred piles
driven deep into the soil; and they rise to a great
height,&mdash;the coping of the parapet being seventy feet above
the level of the valley, in which flow the Sankey brook and
canal.&nbsp; Its total cost was about &pound;45,000.</p>
<p>By the end of 1828 the directors found they had expended
&pound;460,000 on the works, and that they were still far from
completion.&nbsp; They looked at the loss of interest on this
<!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>large investment, and began to grumble at the
delay.&nbsp; They desired to see their capital becoming
productive; and in the spring of 1829 they urged the engineer to
push on the works with increased vigour.&nbsp; Mr. Cropper, one
of the directors, who took an active interest in their progress,
said to Stephenson one day, &ldquo;Now, George, thou must get on
with the railway, and have it finished without further delay;
thou must really have it ready for opening by the first day of
January next.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Consider the heavy character of
the works, sir, and how much we have been delayed by the want of
money, not to speak of the wetness of the weather: it is
impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; rejoined
Cropper; &ldquo;I wish I could get Napoleon to thee&mdash;he
would tell thee there is no such word as &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;
in the vocabulary.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; exclaimed
Stephenson, with warmth; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak to me about
Napoleon!&nbsp; Give me men, money, and materials, and I will do
what Napoleon couldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;drive a railway from
Liverpool to Manchester over Chat Moss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The works made rapid progress in the course of the year
1829.&nbsp; Double sets of labourers were employed on Chat Moss
and at other points, by night and day, the night shifts working
by torch and fire light; and at length, the work advancing at all
points, the directors saw their way to the satisfactory
completion of the undertaking.</p>
<p>It may well be supposed that Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s time was
fully occupied in superintending the extensive, and for the most
part novel works, connected with the railway, and that even his
extraordinary powers of labour and endurance were taxed to the
utmost during the four years that they were in progress.&nbsp;
Almost every detail in the plans was directed and arranged by
himself.&nbsp; Every bridge, from the simplest to the most
complicated, including the then novel structure of the
&ldquo;skew bridge,&rdquo; iron girders, siphons, fixed engines,
and the machinery for working the tunnel at the Liverpool end,
had to be thought out by his own head, and reduced to definite
plans under his own eyes.&nbsp; Besides all <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>this, he
had to design the working plant in anticipation of the opening of
the railway.&nbsp; He must be prepared with waggons, trucks, and
carriages, himself superintending their manufacture.&nbsp; The
permanent road, turntables, switches, and crossings,&mdash;in
short, the entire structure and machinery of the line, from the
turning of the first sod to the running of the first train of
carriages upon the railway,&mdash;were executed under his
immediate supervision.&nbsp; And it was in the midst of this vast
accumulation of work and responsibility that the battle of the
locomotive engine had to be fought,&mdash;a battle, not merely
against material difficulties, but against the still more trying
obstructions of deeply-rooted mistrust and prejudice on the part
of a considerable minority of the directors.</p>
<p>He had no staff of experienced assistants,&mdash;not even a
staff of draughtsmen in his office,&mdash;but only a few pupils
learning their business; and he was frequently without even their
help.&nbsp; The time of his engineering inspectors was fully
occupied in the actual superintendence of the works at different
parts of the line; and he took care to direct all their more
important operations in person.&nbsp; The principal draughtsman
was Mr. Thomas Gooch, a pupil he had brought with him from
Newcastle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may say,&rdquo; writes Mr. Gooch,
&ldquo;that nearly the whole of the working and other drawings,
as well as the various land-plans for the railway, were drawn by
my own hand.&nbsp; They were done at the Company&rsquo;s office
in Clayton Square during the day, from instructions supplied in
the evenings by Mr. Stephenson, either by word of mouth, or by
little rough hand-sketches on letter-paper.&nbsp; The evenings
were also generally devoted to my duties as secretary, in writing
(mostly from his own dictation) his letters and reports, or in
making calculations and estimates.&nbsp; The mornings before
breakfast were not unfrequently spent by me in visiting and
lending a helping hand in the tunnel and other works near
Liverpool,&mdash;the untiring zeal and perseverance of George
Stephenson never for an instant flagging <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>and
inspiring with a like enthusiasm all who were engaged under him
in carrying forward the works.&rdquo; <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a></p>
<p>The usual routine of his life at this time&mdash;if routine it
might be called&mdash;was, to rise early, by sunrise in summer
and before it in winter, and thus &ldquo;break the back of the
day&rsquo;s work&rdquo; by mid-day.&nbsp; While the tunnel under
Liverpool was in progress, one of his first duties in a morning
before breakfast was to go over the various shafts, clothed in a
suitable dress, and inspect their progress at different points;
on other days he would visit the extensive workshops at Edgehill,
where most of the &ldquo;plant&rdquo; for the line was in course
of manufacture.&nbsp; Then, returning to his house, in Upper
Parliament Street, Windsor, after a hurried breakfast, he would
ride along the works to inspect their progress, and push them on
with greater energy where needful.&nbsp; On other days he would
prepare for the much less congenial engagement of meeting the
Board, which was often a cause of great anxiety and pain to him;
for it was difficult to satisfy men of all tempers, and some of
these not of the most generous sort.&nbsp; On such occasions he
might be seen with his right-hand thumb thrust through the
topmost button-hole of his coat-breast, vehemently hitching his
right shoulder, as was his habit when labouring under any
considerable excitement.&nbsp; Occasionally he would take an
early ride before breakfast, to inspect the progress of the
Sankey viaduct.&nbsp; He had a favourite horse, brought by him
from Newcastle, called &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo;&mdash;so tractable
that, with his <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>rider on his back, he would walk up
to a locomotive with the steam blowing off, and put his nose
against it without shying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; saddled and
bridled, was brought to Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s door betimes in
the morning; and mounting him, he would ride the fifteen miles to
Sankey, putting up at a little public house which then stood upon
the banks of the canal.&nbsp; There he had his breakfast of
&ldquo;crowdie,&rdquo; which he made with his own hands.&nbsp; It
consisted of oatmeal stirred into a basin of hot water,&mdash;a
sort of porridge,&mdash;which was supped with cold sweet
milk.&nbsp; After this frugal breakfast, he would go upon the
works, and remain there, riding from point to point for the
greater part of the day.&nbsp; When he returned before mid-day,
he examined the pay-sheets in the different departments, sent in
by the assistant engineers, or by the foremen of the
workshops.&nbsp; To all these he gave his most careful personal
attention, requiring when necessary a full explanation of the
items.</p>
<p>After a late dinner, which occupied very short time and was
always of a plain and frugal description, he disposed of his
correspondence, or prepared sketches of drawings, and gave
instructions as to their completion.&nbsp; He would occasionally
refresh himself for this evening work by a short doze, which,
however, he would never admit had exceeded the limits of
&ldquo;winking,&rdquo; to use his own term.&nbsp; Mr. Frederick
Swanwick, who officiated as his secretary, after the appointment
of Mr. Gooch as Resident Engineer to the Bolton and Leigh
Railway, has informed us that he then remarked&mdash;what in
after years he could better appreciate&mdash;the clear, terse,
and vigorous style of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s dictation.&nbsp;
There was nothing superfluous in it; but it was close, direct,
and to the point,&mdash;in short, thoroughly businesslike.&nbsp;
And if, in passing through the pen of the amanuensis, his meaning
happened in any way to be distorted or modified, it did not fail
to escape his detection, though he was always tolerant of any
liberties taken with his own form of expression, so long as the
words written down conveyed his real meaning.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>His letters and reports written, and his sketches of
drawings made and explained, the remainder of the evening was
usually devoted to conversation with his wife and those of his
pupils who lived under his roof, and constituted, as it were,
part of the family.&nbsp; He then delighted to test the knowledge
of his young companions, and to question them upon the principles
of mechanics.&nbsp; If they were not quite &ldquo;up to the
mark&rdquo; on any point, there was no escaping detection by
evasive or specious explanations.&nbsp; These always brought out
the verdict, &ldquo;Ah! you know nought about it now; but think
it over again, and tell me when you understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If there were even partial success in the reply, it was at once
acknowledged, and a full explanation given, to which the master
would add illustrative examples for the purpose of impressing the
principle more deeply upon the pupil&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>It was not so much his object and purpose to
&ldquo;cram&rdquo; the minds of the young men committed to his
charge with the <i>results</i> of knowledge, as to stimulate them
to educate themselves&mdash;to induce them to develop their
mental and moral powers by the exercise of their own free
energies, and thus acquire that habit of self-thinking and
self-reliance which is the spring of all true manly action.&nbsp;
In a word, he sought to bring out and invigorate the
<i>character</i> of his pupils.&nbsp; He felt that he himself had
been made stronger and better through his encounters with
difficulty; and he would not have the road of knowledge made too
smooth and easy for them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Learn for
yourselves,&mdash;think for yourselves,&rdquo; he would
say:&mdash;&ldquo;make yourselves masters of
principles,&mdash;persevere,&mdash;be industrious,&mdash;and
there is then no fear of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And not the least
emphatic proof of the soundness of this system of education, as
conducted by Mr. Stephenson, was afforded by the after history of
these pupils themselves.&nbsp; There was not one of those trained
under his eye who did not rise to eminent usefulness and
distinction as an engineer.&nbsp; He sent them forth into the
world braced with the spirit of manly self-help&mdash;inspired by
his own noble example; and <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>they
repeated in their after career the lessons of earnest effort and
persistent industry which his daily life had taught them.</p>
<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s evenings at home were not, however,
exclusively devoted either to business or to the graver exercises
above referred to.&nbsp; He would often indulge in cheerful
conversation and anecdote, falling back from time to time upon
the struggles and difficulties of his early life.&nbsp; The not
unfrequent winding up of his story addressed to the young men
about him, was, &ldquo;Ah! ye young fellows don&rsquo;t know what
<i>wark</i> is in these days!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Swanwick takes
pleasure in recalling to mind how seldom, if ever, a cross or
captious word, or an angry look, marred the enjoyment of those
evenings.&nbsp; The presence of Mrs. Stephenson gave them an
additional charm: amiable, kind-hearted, and intelligent, she
shared quietly in the pleasure of the party; and the atmosphere
of comfort which always pervaded her home contributed in no small
degree to render it a centre of cheerful, hopeful intercourse,
and of earnest, honest industry.&nbsp; She was a wife who well
deserved, what she through life retained, the strong and
unremitting affection of her husband.</p>
<p>When Mr. Stephenson retired for the night, it was not always
that he permitted himself to sink into slumber.&nbsp; Like
Brindley, he worked out many a difficult problem in bed; and for
hours he would turn over in his mind and study how to overcome
some obstacle, or to mature some project, on which his thoughts
were bent.&nbsp; Some remark inadvertently dropped by him at the
breakfast-table in the morning, served to show that he had been
stealing some hours from the past night in reflection and
study.&nbsp; Yet he would rise at his accustomed early hour, and
there was no abatement of his usual energy in carrying on the
business of the day.</p>

Return</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Battle of the
Locomotive</span>&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
Rocket</span>.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>We return to the career of Robert Stephenson, who had been
absent from England during the construction of the Liverpool
railway, but was shortly about to join his father and take part
in &ldquo;the battle of the locomotive,&rdquo; which was now
impending.</p>
<p>On his return from Edinburgh College in the summer of 1823, he
had assisted in the survey of the Stockton and Darlington line;
and when the Locomotive Engine Works were started in Forth
Street, Newcastle, he took an active part in that concern.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The factory,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was in active
operation early in 1824; I left England for Colombia in June of
that year, having finished drawing the designs of the Brusselton
stationary engines for the Stockton and Darlington Railway before
I left.&rdquo; <a name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a></p>
<p>Speculation was very rife at the time; and amongst the most
promising adventures were the companies organised for the purpose
of working the gold and silver mines of South America.&nbsp;
Great difficulty was experienced in finding mining engineers
capable of carrying out those projects, and young men of even the
most moderate experience were eagerly sought after.&nbsp; The
Columbian Mining Association of London offered an engagement to
young Stephenson, to go out to Mariquita and take charge of the
engineering operations of that company.&nbsp; Robert was himself
desirous of accepting it, but his father said it would first be
necessary to ascertain whether the proposed change would be for
his <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>good.&nbsp; His health had been very
delicate for some time, partly occasioned by his rapid growth,
but principally because of his close application to work and
study.&nbsp; Father and son together called upon Dr. Headlam, the
eminent physician of Newcastle, to consult him on the
subject.&nbsp; During the examination which ensued, Robert
afterwards used to say that he felt as if he were upon trial for
life or death.&nbsp; To his great relief, the doctor pronounced
that a temporary residence in a warm climate was the very thing
likely to be most beneficial to him.&nbsp; The appointment was
accordingly accepted, and, before many weeks had passed, Robert
Stephenson set sail for South America.</p>
<p>After a tolerably prosperous voyage he landed at La Guayra, on
the north coast of Venezuela, on the 23rd July, from thence
proceeding to Caraccas, the capital of the district, about 15
miles inland.&nbsp; There he remained for two months, unable to
proceed in consequence of the wretched state of the roads in the
interior.&nbsp; He contrived, however, to make occasional
excursions in the neighbourhood, with an eye to the mining
business on which he had come.&nbsp; About the beginning of
October he set out for Bogota, the capital of Columbia or New
Granada.&nbsp; The distance was about 1200 miles, through a very
difficult region, and it was performed entirely upon mule-back
after the fashion of the country.</p>
<p>In the course of the journey Robert visited many of the
districts reported to be rich in minerals, but he met with few
traces except of copper, iron, and coal, with occasional
indications of gold and silver.&nbsp; He found the people ready
to furnish information, which, however, when tested, usually
proved worthless.&nbsp; A guide whom he employed for weeks, kept
him buoyed up with the hope of richer mining quarters than he had
yet seen; but when he professed to be able to show him mines of
&ldquo;brass, steel, alcohol, and pinchbeck,&rdquo; Stephenson
discovered him to be an incorrigible rogue, and immediately
dismissed him.&nbsp; At length our traveller reached Bogota, and
after an interview with Mr. <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Illingworth, the commercial manager of the mining
Company, he proceeded to Honda, crossed the Magdalena, and
shortly after reached the site of his intended operations on the
eastern slopes of the Andes.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson used afterwards to speak in glowing terms of
this his first mule-journey in South America.&nbsp; Everything
was entirely new to him.&nbsp; The variety and beauty of the
indigenous plants, the luxurious tropical vegetation, the
appearance, manners, and dress of the people, and the mode of
travelling, were altogether different from everything he had
before seen.&nbsp; His own travelling garb also must have been
strange even to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;My hat,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;was of plaited grass, with a crown nine inches in height,
surrounded by a brim of six inches; a white cotton suit; and a
<i>ruana</i> of blue and crimson plaid, with a hole in the centre
for the head to pass through.&nbsp; This cloak is admirably
adapted for the purpose, amply covering the rider and mule, and
at night answering the purpose of a blanket in the net-hammock,
which is made from fibres of the aloe, and which every traveller
carries before him on his mule, and suspends to the trees or in
houses, as occasion may require.&rdquo;&nbsp; The part of the
journey which seems to have made the most lasting impression on
his mind was that between Bogota and the mining district in the
neighbourhood of Mariquita.&nbsp; As he ascended the slopes of
the mountain-range, and reached the first step of the table-land,
he was struck beyond expression with the noble view of the valley
of the Magdalena behind him, so vast that he failed in attempting
to define the point at which the course of the river blended with
the horizon.&nbsp; Like all travellers in the district, he noted
the remarkable changes of climate and vegetation, as he rose from
the burning plains towards the fresh breath of the
mountains.&nbsp; From an atmosphere as hot as that of an oven he
passed into delicious cool air; until, in his onward and upward
journey, a still more temperate region was reached, the very
perfection of climate.&nbsp; Before him rose the majestic <!--
page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Cordilleras, forming a rampart against the western
skies, at certain times of the day looking black, sharp, and, at
their summit, almost as even as a wall.</p>
<p>Our engineer took up his abode for a time at Mariquita, a fine
old city, though then greatly decayed.&nbsp; During the period of
the Spanish dominion, it was an important place, most of the gold
and silver convoys passing through it on their way to Cartagena,
there to be shipped in galleons for Europe.&nbsp; The mountainous
country to the west was rich in silver, gold, and other metals,
and it was Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s object to select the best site
for commencing operations for the Company.&nbsp; With this object
he &ldquo;prospected&rdquo; about in all directions, visiting
long-abandoned mines, and analysing specimens obtained from many
quarters.&nbsp; The mines eventually fixed upon as the scene of
his operations were those of La Manta and Santa Anna, long before
worked by the Spaniards, though, in consequence of the luxuriance
and rapidity of the vegetation, all traces of the old workings
had become completely overgrown and lost.&nbsp; Everything had to
be begun anew.&nbsp; Roads had to be cut to the mines, machinery
to be erected, and the ground opened up, in course of which some
of the old adits were hit upon.&nbsp; The native peons or
labourers were not accustomed to work, and at first they usually
contrived to desert when they were not watched, so that very
little progress could be made until the arrival of the expected
band of miners from England.&nbsp; The authorities were by no
means helpful, and the engineer was driven to an old expedient
with the object of overcoming this difficulty.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
endeavour all we can,&rdquo; he says, in one of his letters,
&ldquo;to make ourselves popular, and this we find most
effectually accomplished by &lsquo;regaling the venal
beasts.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation196"></a><a
href="#footnote196" class="citation">[196]</a>&nbsp; He also gave
a ball at Mariquita, which passed off with <i>&eacute;clat</i>,
the governor from Honda, with a host of friends, honouring it
with their presence.&nbsp; It was, indeed, necessary to
&ldquo;make a party&rdquo; in this way, <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>as other
schemers were already trying to undermine the Colombian company
in influential directions.&nbsp; The engineer did not exaggerate
when he said, &ldquo;The uncertainty of transacting business in
this country is perplexing beyond description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, his party of miners arrived from England, but they
gave him even more trouble than the peons had done.&nbsp; They
were rough, drunken, and sometimes altogether ungovernable.&nbsp;
He set them to work at the Santa Anna mine without delay, and at
the same time took up his abode amongst them, &ldquo;to keep
them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if possible, from indulging in the
detestable vice of drunkenness, which, if not put a stop to, will
eventually destroy themselves, and involve the mining association
in ruin.&rdquo;&nbsp; To add to his troubles, the captain of the
miners displayed a very hostile and insubordinate spirit,
quarrelled and fought with the men, and was insolent to the
engineer himself.&nbsp; The captain and his gang, being Cornish
men, told Robert to his face, that because he was a North-country
man, and not born in Cornwall it was impossible he should know
anything of mining.&nbsp; Disease also fell upon him,&mdash;first
fever, and then visceral derangement, followed by a return of his
&ldquo;old complaint, a feeling of oppression in the
breast.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder that in the midst of these
troubles he should longingly speak of returning to his native
land.&nbsp; But he stuck to his post and his duty, kept up his
courage, and by a mixture of mildness and firmness, and the
display of great coolness of judgment, he contrived to keep the
men to their work, and gradually to carry forward the enterprise
which he had undertaken.&nbsp; By the beginning of July, 1826, we
find that quietness and order had been restored, and the works
were proceeding more satisfactorily, though the yield of silver
was not as yet very promising.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson calculated
that at least three years&rsquo; diligent and costly operations
would be needed to render the mines productive.</p>
<p>In the mean time he removed to the dwelling which had been
erected for his accommodation at Santa Anna.&nbsp; It was <!--

</a></p>
<p>The walls were of split and flattened bamboo, tied together
with the long fibres of a dried climbing plant; the roof was of
palm-leaves, and the ceiling of reeds.&nbsp; When an earthquake
shook the district&mdash;for earthquakes were frequent&mdash;the
inmates of such a fabric merely felt as if shaken in a basket,
without sustaining any harm.&nbsp; In front of the cottage lay a
woody ravine, extending almost to the base of the Andes,
gorgeously clothed in primeval vegetation&mdash;magnolias, palms,
bamboos, tree-ferns, acacias, cedars; and, towering over all, the
great almendrons, with their smooth, silvery stems, bearing aloft
noble clusters of pure white blossom.&nbsp; The forest was
haunted by myriads of gay insects, butterflies with wings of
dazzling lustre, birds of brilliant plumage, humming-birds,
golden orioles, toucans, and a <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>host of
solitary warblers.&nbsp; But the glorious sunsets seen from his
cottage-porch more than all astonished and delighted the young
engineer; and he was accustomed to say that, after having
witnessed them, he was reluctant to accuse the ancient Peruvians
of idolatry.</p>
<p>But all these natural beauties failed to reconcile him to the
harassing difficulties of his situation, which continued to
increase rather than diminish.&nbsp; He was hampered by the
action of the Board at home, who gave ear to hostile criticisms
on his reports; and, although they afterwards made handsome
acknowledgment of his services, he felt his position to be
altogether unsatisfactory.&nbsp; He therefore determined to leave
at the expiry of his three years engagement, and communicated his
decision to the directors accordingly.&nbsp; On receiving his
letter, the Board, through Mr. Richardson, of Lombard street, one
of the directors, communicated with his father at Newcastle,
representing that if he would allow his son to remain in Colombia
the Company would make it &ldquo;worth his while.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
this the father gave a decided negative, and intimated that he
himself needed his son&rsquo;s assistance, and that he must
return at the expiry of his three years&rsquo; term,&mdash;a
decision, writes Robert, &ldquo;at which I feel much gratified,
as it is clear that he is as anxious to have me back in England
as I am to get there.&rdquo; <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; At the same
time, Edward Pease, a principal partner in the Newcastle firm,
privately wrote Robert to the following effect, urging his return
home:&mdash;&ldquo;I can assure thee that thy business at
Newcastle, as well as thy father&rsquo;s engineering, have
suffered very much from thy absence, and, unless thou soon
return, the former will be given up, as Mr. Longridge is not able
to give it that attention it requires; and what is done is not
done with credit to the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of the
manufactory being given up, which Robert had laboured so hard to
establish before leaving England, was painful to him in the
extreme, and he wrote to the <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>manager of
the Company, strongly urging that arrangements should be made for
him to leave without delay.&nbsp; In the mean time he was again
laid prostrate by another violent attack of aguish fever; and
when able to write in June, 1827, he expressed himself as
&ldquo;completely wearied and worn down with vexation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length, when he was sufficiently recovered from his attack
and able to travel, he set out on his voyage homeward in the
beginning of August.&nbsp; At Mompox, on his way down the river
Magdalena, he met Mr. Bodmer, his successor, with a fresh party
of miners from England, on their way up the country to the
quarters which he had just quitted.&nbsp; Next day, six hours
after leaving Mompox, a steamboat was met ascending the river,
with Bolivar the Liberator on board, on his way to St. Bogota;
and it was a mortification to our engineer that he had only a
passing sight of that distinguished person.&nbsp; It was his
intention, on leaving Mariquita, to visit the Isthmus of Panama
on his way home, for the purpose of inquiring into the
practicability of cutting a canal to unite the Atlantic and
Pacific&mdash;a project which then formed the subject of
considerable public discussion; but his presence being so
anxiously desired at home, he determined to proceed to New York
without delay.</p>
<p>Arrived at the port of Cartagena, he had to wait some time for
a ship.&nbsp; The delay was very irksome to him, the more so as
the city was then desolated by the ravages of the yellow
fever.&nbsp; While sitting one day in the large, bare,
comfortless public room at the miserable hotel at which he put
up, he observed two strangers, whom he at once perceived to be
English.&nbsp; One of the strangers was a tall, gaunt man,
shrunken and hollow-looking, shabbily dressed, and apparently
poverty-stricken.&nbsp; On making inquiry, he found it was
Trevithick, the builder of the first railroad locomotive!&nbsp;
He was returning home from the gold-mines of Peru
penniless.&nbsp; He had left England in 1816, with powerful
steam-engines, intended for the drainage and working of the <!--
page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>Peruvian mines.&nbsp; He met with almost a royal
reception on his landing at Lima.&nbsp; A guard of honour was
appointed to attend him, and it was even proposed to erect a
statue of Don Ricardo Trevithick in solid silver.&nbsp; It was
given forth in Cornwall that his emoluments amounted to
&pound;100,000 a year, <a name="citation201"></a><a
href="#footnote201" class="citation">[201]</a> and that he was
making a gigantic fortune.&nbsp; Great, therefore, was Robert
Stephenson&rsquo;s surprise to find this potent Don Ricardo in
the inn at Cartagena, reduced almost to his last shilling, and
unable to proceed further.&nbsp; He had indeed realised the truth
of the Spanish proverb, that &ldquo;a silver-mine brings misery,
a gold-mine ruin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He and his friend had lost
everything in their journey across the country from Peru.&nbsp;
They had forded rivers and wandered through forests, leaving all
their baggage behind them, and had reached thus far with little
more than the clothes upon their backs.&nbsp; Almost the only
remnant of precious metal saved by Trevithick was a pair of
silver spurs, which he took back with him to Cornwall.&nbsp;
Robert Stephenson lent him &pound;50 to enable him to reach
England; and though he was afterwards heard of as an inventor
there, he had no further part in the ultimate triumph of the
locomotive.</p>
<p>But Trevithick&rsquo;s misadventures on this occasion had not
yet ended, for before he reached New York he was wrecked, and
Robert Stephenson with him.&nbsp; The following is the account of
the voyage, &ldquo;big with adventures,&rdquo; as given by the
latter in a letter to his friend Illingworth:&mdash;&ldquo;At
first we had very little foul weather, and indeed were for
several days becalmed amongst the islands, which was so far
fortunate, for a few degrees further north the most tremendous
gales were blowing, and they appear (from our future information)
to have wrecked every vessel exposed to their violence.&nbsp; We
had two examples of the effects of the hurricane; for, as we
sailed north we took on board the remains of two crews found
floating about on dismantled hulls.&nbsp; The one had been nine
days without food of any <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>kind,
except the carcasses of two of their companions who had died a
day or two previously from fatigue and hunger.&nbsp; The other
crew had been driven about for six days, and were not so
dejected, but reduced to such a weak state that they were obliged
to be drawn on board our vessel by ropes.&nbsp; A brig bound for
Havannah took part of the men, and we took the remainder.&nbsp;
To attempt any description of my feelings on witnessing such
scenes would be in vain.&nbsp; You will not be surprised to learn
that I felt somewhat uneasy at the thought that we were so far
from England, and that I also might possibly suffer similar
shipwreck; but I consoled myself with the hope that fate would be
more kind to us.&nbsp; It was not so much so, however, as I had
flattered myself; for on voyaging towards New York, after we had
made the land, we ran aground about midnight.&nbsp; The vessel
soon filled with water, and, being surrounded by the breaking
surf, the ship was soon split up, and before morning our
situation became perilous.&nbsp; Masts and all were cut away to
prevent the hull rocking; but all we could do was of no
avail.&nbsp; About 8 o&rsquo;clock on the following morning,
after a most miserable night, we were taken off the wreck, and
were so fortunate as to reach the shore.&nbsp; I saved my
minerals, but Empson lost part of his botanical collection.&nbsp;
Upon the whole, we got off well; and, had I not been on the
American side of the Atlantic, I &lsquo;guess&rsquo; I would not
have gone to sea again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short tour in the United States and Canada, Robert
Stephenson and his friend took ship for Liverpool, where they
arrived at the end of November, and at once proceeded to
Newcastle.&nbsp; The factory was by no means in a prosperous
state.&nbsp; During the time Robert had been in America it had
been carried on at a loss; and Edward Pease, much disheartened,
wished to retire, but George Stephenson was unable to buy him
out, and the establishment had to be carried on in the hope that
the locomotive might yet be established in public estimation as a
practical and economical working power.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson
<!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>immediately instituted a rigid inquiry into the working
of the concern, unravelled the accounts, which had fallen into
confusion during his father&rsquo;s absence at Liverpool; and he
soon succeeded in placing the affairs of the factory in a more
healthy condition.&nbsp; In all this he had the hearty support of
his father, as well as of the other partners.</p>
<p>The works of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were now
approaching completion.&nbsp; But, singular to say, the directors
had not yet decided as to the tractive power to be employed in
working the line when opened for traffic.&nbsp; The differences
of opinion among them were so great as apparently to be
irreconcilable.&nbsp; It was necessary, however, that they should
come to some decision without further loss of time; and many
Board meetings were accordingly held to discuss the
subject.&nbsp; The old-fashioned and well-tried system of horse
haulage was not without its advocates; but, looking at the large
amount of traffic which there was to be conveyed, and at the
probable delay in the transit from station to station if this
method were adopted, the directors, after a visit made by them to
the Northumberland and Durham railways in 1828, came to the
conclusion that the employment of horse power was
inadmissible.</p>
<p>Fixed engines had many advocates; the locomotive very few: it
stood as yet almost in a minority of one&mdash;George
Stephenson.&nbsp; The prejudice against the employment of the
latter power had even increased since the Liverpool and
Manchester Bill underwent its first ordeal in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; In proof of this, we may mention that the
Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Act was conceded in 1829, on the
express condition that it should <i>not</i> be worked by
locomotives, but by horses only.</p>
<p>Grave doubts existed as to the practicability of working a
large traffic by means of travelling engines.&nbsp; The most
celebrated engineers offered no opinion on the subject.&nbsp;
They did not believe in the locomotive, and would scarcely take
the trouble to examine it.&nbsp; The ridicule with which George
Stephenson had been assailed by the barristers <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>before the
Parliamentary Committee had not been altogether distasteful to
them.&nbsp; Perhaps they did not relish the idea of a man who had
picked up his experience in Newcastle coal-pits appearing in the
capacity of a leading engineer before Parliament, and attempting
to establish a new system of internal communication in the
country.&nbsp; The directors could not disregard the adverse and
conflicting views of the professional men whom they
consulted.&nbsp; But Mr. Stephenson had so repeatedly and
earnestly urged upon them the propriety of making a trial of the
locomotive before coming to any decision against it, that they at
length authorised him to proceed with the construction of one of
his engines by way of experiment.&nbsp; In their report to the
proprietors at their annual meeting on, the 27th March, 1828,
they state that they had, after due consideration, authorised the
engineer &ldquo;to prepare a locomotive engine, which, from the
nature of its construction and from the experiments already made,
he is of opinion will be effective for the purposes of the
Company, without proving an annoyance to the public.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The locomotive thus ordered was placed upon the line in 1829, and
was found of great service in drawing the waggons full of marl
from the two great cuttings.</p>
<p>In the mean time the discussion proceeded as to the kind of
power to be permanently employed for the working of the
railway.&nbsp; The directors were inundated with schemes of all
sorts for facilitating locomotion.&nbsp; The projectors of
England, France, and America, seemed to be let loose upon
them.&nbsp; There were plans for working the waggons along the
line by water power.&nbsp; Some proposed hydrogen, and others
carbonic acid gas.&nbsp; Atmospheric pressure had its eager
advocates.&nbsp; And various kinds of fixed and locomotive
steam-power were suggested.&nbsp; Thomas Gray urged his plan of a
greased road with cog rails; and Messrs. Vignolles and Ericsson
recommended the adoption of a central friction rail, against
which two horizontal rollers under the locomotive, pressing upon
the sides of this rail, <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>were to
afford the means of ascending the inclined planes.&nbsp; The
directors felt themselves quite unable to choose from amidst this
multitude of projects.&nbsp; The engineer expressed himself as
decidedly as heretofore in favour of smooth rails and locomotive
engines, which, he was confident, would be found the most
economical and by far the most convenient moving power that could
be employed.&nbsp; The Stockton and Darlington Railway being now
at work, another deputation went down personally to inspect the
fixed and locomotive engines on that line, as well as at Hetton
and Killingworth.&nbsp; They returned to Liverpool with much
information; but their testimony as to the relative merits of the
two kinds of engines was so contradictory, that the directors
were as far from a decision as ever.</p>
<p>They then resolved to call to their aid two professional
engineers of high standing, who should visit the Darlington and
Newcastle railways, carefully examine both modes of
working&mdash;the fixed and the locomotive,&mdash;and report to
them fully on the subject.&nbsp; The gentlemen selected were Mr.
Walker of Limehouse, and Mr. Rastrick of Stourbridge.&nbsp; After
carefully examining the modes of working the northern railways,
they made their report to the directors in the spring of
1829.&nbsp; They concurred in the opinion that the cost of an
establishment of fixed engines would be somewhat greater than
that of locomotives to do the same work; but thought the annual
charge would be less if the former were adopted.&nbsp; They
calculated that the cost of moving a ton of goods thirty miles by
fixed engines would be 6.40d., and by locomotives,
8.36d.,&mdash;assuming a profitable traffic to be obtained both
ways.&nbsp; At the same time it was admitted that there appeared
more ground for expecting improvements in the construction and
working of locomotives than of stationary engines.&nbsp; On the
whole, however, and looking especially at the computed annual
charge of working the road on the two systems on a large scale,
the two reporting engineers were of opinion that fixed engines
were preferable, and accordingly recommended their
adoption.&nbsp; And, in <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>order to
carry the system recommended by them into effect, they proposed
to divide the railroad between Liverpool and Manchester into
nineteen stages of about a mile and a half each, with twenty-one
engines fixed at the different points to work the trains
forward.</p>
<p>Such was the result, so far, of George Stephenson&rsquo;s
labours.&nbsp; Two of the best practical engineers of the day
concurred in reporting substantially in favour of the employment
of fixed engines.&nbsp; Not a single professional man of eminence
supported the engineer in his preference for locomotive over
fixed engine power.&nbsp; He had scarcely an adherent, and the
locomotive system seemed on the eve of being abandoned.&nbsp;
Still he did not despair.&nbsp; With the profession as well as
public opinion against him&mdash;for the most frightful stories
were abroad respecting the dangers, the unsightliness, and the
nuisance which the locomotive would create&mdash;Stephenson held
to his purpose.&nbsp; Even in this, apparently the darkest hour
of the locomotive, he did not hesitate to declare that locomotive
railroads would, before many years had passed, be &ldquo;the
great highways of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He urged his views upon the directors in all ways, and, as
some of them thought, at all seasons.&nbsp; He pointed out the
greater convenience of locomotive power for the purposes of a
public highway, likening it to a series of short unconnected
chains, any one of which could be removed and another substituted
without interruption to the traffic; whereas the fixed engine
system might be regarded in the light of a continuous chain
extending between the two termini, the failure of any link of
which would derange the whole. <a name="citation206"></a><a
href="#footnote206" class="citation">[206]</a>&nbsp; He
represented to the Board that the locomotive <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>was yet
capable of great improvements, if proper inducements were held
out to inventors and machinists to make them; and he pledged
himself that, if time were given him, he would construct an
engine that should satisfy their requirements, and prove itself
capable of working heavy loads along the railway with speed,
regularity and safety.&nbsp; At length, influenced by his
persistent earnestness not less than by his arguments, the
directors, at the suggestion of Mr. Harrison, determined to offer
a prize of &pound;500 for the best locomotive engine, which, on a
certain day, should be produced on the railway, and perform
certain specified conditions in the most satisfactory manner. <a
name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a></p>
<p>It was now felt that the fate of railways in a great measure
depended upon the issue of this appeal to the mechanical genius
of England.&nbsp; When the advertisement of the prize for the
best locomotive was published, scientific men began more
particularly to direct their attention to the new power which was
thus struggling into existence.&nbsp; In the mean time public
opinion on the subject of railway <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>working
remained suspended, and the progress of the undertaking was
watched with intense interest.</p>
<p>During the progress of the discussion with reference to the
kind of power to be employed, Mr. Stephenson was in constant
communication with his son Robert, who made frequent visits to
Liverpool for the purpose of assisting his father in the
preparation of his reports to the Board on the subject.&nbsp;
They had also many conversations as to the best mode of
increasing the powers and perfecting the mechanism of the
locomotive.&nbsp; These became more frequent and interesting,
when the prize was offered for the best locomotive, and the
working plans of the engine which they proposed to construct came
to be settled.</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations in the new engine was
the arrangement of the boiler and the extension of its heating
surface to enable steam enough to be raised rapidly and
continuously, for the purpose of maintaining high rates of
speed,&mdash;the effect of high-pressure engines being
ascertained to depend mainly upon the quantity of steam which the
boiler can generate, and upon its degree of elasticity when
produced.&nbsp; The quantity of steam so generated, it will be
obvious, must depend chiefly upon the quantity of fuel consumed
in the furnace, and by necessary consequence, upon the high rate
of temperature maintained there.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in Stephenson&rsquo;s first
Killingworth engines he invented and applied the ingenious method
of stimulating combustion in the furnace, by throwing the waste
steam into the chimney after performing its office in the
cylinders, thus accelerating the ascent of the current of air,
greatly increasing the draught, and consequently the temperature
of the fire.&nbsp; This plan was adopted by him, as we have
already seen, as early as 1815; and it was so successful that he
himself attributed to it the greater economy of the locomotive as
compared with horse power.&nbsp; Hence the continuance of its use
upon the Killingworth Railway.</p>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>Though the adoption of the steam-blast greatly
quickened combustion and contributed to the rapid production of
high-pressure steam, the limited amount of heating surface
presented to the fire was still felt to be an obstacle to the
complete success of the locomotive engine.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson
endeavoured to overcome this by lengthening the boilers and
increasing the surface presented by the flue-tubes.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Lancashire Witch,&rdquo; which he built for the Bolton and
Leigh Railway, and used in forming the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway embankments, was constructed with a double tube, each of
which contained a fire and passed longitudinally through the
boiler.&nbsp; But this arrangement necessarily led to a
considerable increase in the weight of the engine, which amounted
to about twelve tons; and as six tons was the limit allowed for
engines admitted to the Liverpool competition, it was clear that
the time was come when the Killingworth locomotive must undergo a
further important modification.</p>
<p>For many years previous to this period, ingenious mechanics
had been engaged in attempting to solve the problem of the best
and most economical boiler for the production of high-pressure
steam.&nbsp; As early as 1803, Mr. Woolf patented a tubular
boiler, which was extensively employed at the Cornish mines, and
was found greatly to facilitate the production of steam, by the
extension of the heating surface.&nbsp; The ingenious Trevithick,
in his patent of 1815, seems also to have entertained the idea of
employing a boiler constructed of &ldquo;small perpendicular
tubes,&rdquo; with the same object of increasing the heating
surface.&nbsp; These tubes were to be closed at the bottom, and
open into a common reservoir, from which they were to receive
their water, and where the steam of all the tubes was to be
united.</p>
<p>About the same time George Stephenson was trying the effect of
introducing small tubes in the boilers of his locomotives, with
the object of increasing their evaporative power.&nbsp; Thus, in
1829, he sent to France two engines constructed at the Newcastle
works for the Lyons and St. <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Etienne
Railway, in the boilers of which tubes were placed containing
water.&nbsp; The heating surface was thus found to be materially
increased; but the expedient was not successful, for the tubes,
becoming furred with deposit, shortly burned out and were
removed.&nbsp; It was then that M. Seguin, the engineer of the
railway, pursuing the same idea, adopted his plan of employing
horizontal tubes through which the heated air passed in
streamlets.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Booth, the secretary of the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway, without any knowledge of M.
Seguin&rsquo;s proceedings, next devised his plan of a tubular
boiler, which he brought under the notice of Mr. Stephenson, who
at once adopted it, and settled the mode in which the fire-box
and tubes were to be mutually arranged and connected.&nbsp; This
plan was adopted in the construction of the celebrated
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; engine, the building of which was
immediately proceeded with at the Newcastle works.</p>
<p>The principal circumstances connected with the construction of
the &ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; as described by Robert Stephenson to
the author, may be briefly stated.&nbsp; The tubular principle
was adopted in a more complete manner than had yet been
attempted.&nbsp; Twenty-five copper tubes, each three inches in
diameter, extended from one end of the boiler to the other, the
heated air passing through them on its way to the chimney; and
the tubes being surrounded by the water of the boiler, it will be
obvious that a large extension of the <i>heating surface</i> was
thus effectually secured.&nbsp; The principal difficulty was in
fitting the copper tubes within the boiler so as to prevent
leakage.&nbsp; They were made by a Newcastle coppersmith, and
soldered to brass screws which were screwed into the boiler ends,
standing out in great knobs.&nbsp; When the tubes were thus
fitted, and the boiler was filled with water, hydraulic pressure
was applied; but the water squirted out at every joint, and the
factory floor was soon flooded.&nbsp; Robert went home in
despair; and in the first moment of grief, he wrote to his father
that the whole thing was a failure.&nbsp; By return of post came
a letter from <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>his father, telling him that despair
was not to be thought of&mdash;that he must &ldquo;try
again;&rdquo; and he suggested a mode of overcoming the
difficulty, which his son had already anticipated and proceeded
to adopt.&nbsp; It was, to bore clean holes in the boiler ends,
fit in the smooth copper tubes as tightly as possible, solder up,
and then raise the steam.&nbsp; This plan succeeded perfectly,
the expansion of the copper tubes completely filling up all
interstices, and producing a perfectly watertight boiler, capable
of withstanding extreme internal pressure.</p>
<p>The mode of employing the steam-blast for the purpose of
increasing the draught in the chimney, was also the subject of
numerous experiments.&nbsp; When the engine was first tried, it
was thought that the blast in the chimney was not strong enough
to keep up the intensity of the fire in the furnace, so as to
produce high-pressure steam in sufficient quantity.&nbsp; The
expedient was therefore adopted of hammering the copper tubes at
the point at which they entered the chimney, whereby the blast
was considerably sharpened; and on a further trial it was found
that the draught was increased to such an extent as to enable
abundance of steam to be raised.&nbsp; The rationale of the blast
may be simply explained by referring to the effect of contracting
the pipe of a water-hose, by which the force of the jet of water
is proportionately increased.&nbsp; Widen the nozzle of the pipe,
and the force is in like manner diminished.&nbsp; So is it with
the steam-blast in the chimney of the locomotive.</p>
<p>Doubts were, however, expressed whether the greater draught
secured by the contraction of the blast-pipe was not
counterbalanced in some degree by the negative pressure upon the
piston.&nbsp; A series of experiments was made with pipes of
different diameters; the amount of vacuum produced being
determined by a glass tube open at both ends, which was fixed to
the bottom of the smoke-box, and descended into a bucket of
water.&nbsp; As the rarefaction took place, the water would of
course rise in the tube; and the height to which it rose above
the surface <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>of the water in the bucket was made
the measure of the amount of rarefaction.&nbsp; These experiments
proved that a considerable increase of draught was obtained by
the contraction of the orifice; accordingly, the two blast-pipes
opening from the cylinders into either side of the
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; chimney, and turned up within it, were
contracted slightly below the area of the steam-ports; and before
the engine left the factory, the water rose in the glass tube
three inches above the water in the bucket.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The other arrangements of the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; were
briefly these:&mdash;the boiler was cylindrical with flat ends, 6
feet in length, and 3 feet 4 inches in diameter.&nbsp; The upper
half of the boiler was used as a reservoir for the steam, the
lower half being filled with water.&nbsp; Through the lower part,
25 copper tubes of 3 inches diameter extended, which were open to
the fire-box at one end, and to the chimney at the other.&nbsp;
The fire-box, or furnace, 2 feet wide and 3 <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>feet high,
was attached immediately behind the boiler, and was also
surrounded with water.&nbsp; The cylinders of the engine were
placed on each side of the boiler, in an oblique position, one
end being nearly level with the top of the boiler at its after
end, and the other pointing towards the centre of the foremost or
driving pair of wheels, with which the connection was directly
made from the piston-rod, to a pin on the outside of the
wheel.&nbsp; The engine, together with its load of water, weighed
only 4&frac14; tons, and was supported on four wheels, not
coupled.&nbsp; The tender was four-wheeled, and similar in shape
to a waggon,&mdash;the foremost part holding the fuel, and the
hind part a water-cask.</p>
<p>When the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; was finished, it was placed upon
the Killingworth railway for the purpose of experiment.&nbsp; The
new boiler arrangement was found perfectly successful.&nbsp; The
steam was raised rapidly and continuously, and in a quantity
which then appeared marvellous.&nbsp; The same evening Robert
despatched a letter to his father at Liverpool, informing him, to
his great joy, that the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; was &ldquo;all
right,&rdquo; and would be in complete working trim by the day of
trial.&nbsp; The engine was shortly after sent by waggon to
Carlisle, and thence shipped for Liverpool.</p>
<p>The time so much longed for by George Stephenson had now
arrived, when the merit of the passenger locomotive was to be put
to a public test.&nbsp; He had fought the battle for it until now
almost single-handed.&nbsp; Engrossed by his daily labours and
anxieties, and harassed by difficulties and discouragements which
would have crushed the spirit of a less resolute man, he had held
firmly to his purpose through good and through evil report.&nbsp;
The hostility which he experienced from some of the directors
opposed to the adoption of the locomotive, was the circumstance
that caused him the greatest grief of all; for where he had
looked for encouragement, he found only carping and
opposition.&nbsp; But his pluck never failed him; and now the
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; was upon the <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>ground,&mdash;to prove, to use his own words,
&ldquo;whether he was a man of his word or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great interest was felt at Liverpool, as well as throughout
the country, in the approaching competition.&nbsp; Engineers,
scientific men, and mechanics, arrived from all quarters to
witness the novel display of mechanical ingenuity on which such
great results depended.&nbsp; The public generally were no
indifferent spectators either.&nbsp; The inhabitants of
Liverpool, Manchester, and the adjacent towns felt that the
successful issue of the experiment would confer upon them
individual benefits and local advantages almost incalculable,
whilst populations at a distance waited for the result with
almost equal interest.</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the great competition of locomotives
at Rainhill, the following engines were entered for the
prize:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Novelty.&rdquo; <a name="citation214"></a><a
href="#footnote214" class="citation">[214]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Mr. Timothy Hackworth&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sanspareil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Messrs. R. Stephenson and Co.&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Rocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Mr. Burstall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another engine was entered by Mr. Brandreth of
Liverpool&mdash;the &ldquo;Cycloped,&rdquo; weighing 3 tons,
worked by a horse in a frame, but it could not be admitted to the
competition.&nbsp; The above were the only four exhibited, out of
a considerable number of engines constructed in different parts
of the country in anticipation of this contest, many of which
could not be satisfactorily completed by the day of trial.</p>
<p>The ground on which the engines were to be tried was a level
piece of railroad, about two miles in length.&nbsp; Each was
required to make twenty trips, or equal to a journey <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of
70 miles, in the course of the day; and the average rate of
travelling was to be not under 10 miles an hour.&nbsp; It was
determined that, to avoid confusion, each engine should be tried
separately, and on different days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The day fixed for the competition was the 1st of October, but
to allow sufficient time to get the locomotives into good working
order, the directors extended it to the 6th.&nbsp; On the morning
of the 6th, the ground at Rainhill presented a lively appearance,
and there was as much excitement as if the St. Leger were about
to be run.&nbsp; Many thousand spectators looked on, amongst whom
were some of the first engineers and mechanicians of the
day.&nbsp; A stand was provided for the ladies; the &ldquo;beauty
and fashion&rdquo; of the neighbourhood were present, and the
side of the railroad was lined with carriages of all
descriptions.</p>
<p>It was quite characteristic of the Stephensons, that, although
their engine did not stand first on the list for trial, it was
the first that was ready; and it was accordingly ordered out by
the judges for an experimental trip.&nbsp; Yet the
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; was by no means &ldquo;the favourite&rdquo;
with either the judges or the spectators.&nbsp; A majority of the
judges was <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>strongly predisposed in favour of
the &ldquo;Novelty,&rdquo; and nine-tenths of those present were
against the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; because of its appearance.&nbsp;
Nearly every person favoured some other engine, so that there was
nothing for the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; but the practical
test.&nbsp; The first trip which it made was quite
successful.&nbsp; It ran about 12 miles, without interruption, in
about 53 minutes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; was next called out.&nbsp; It was a
light engine, very compact in appearance, carrying the water and
fuel upon the same wheels as the engine.&nbsp; The weight of the
whole was only 3 tons and 1 hundredweight.&nbsp; A peculiarity of
this engine was that the air was driven or forced through the
fire by means of bellows.&nbsp; The day being now far advanced,
and some dispute having arisen as to the method of assigning the
proper load for the &ldquo;Novelty,&rdquo; no particular
experiment was made, further than that the engine traversed the
line by way of exhibition, occasionally moving at the rate of 24
miles an hour.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Sanspareil,&rdquo; constructed by
Mr. Timothy Hackworth, was next exhibited; but no particular
experiment was made with it on this day.</p>
<p>The contest was postponed until the following day, but before
the judges arrived on the ground, the bellows for creating the
blast in the &ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; gave way, and it was found
incapable of going through its performance.&nbsp; A defect was
also detected in the boiler of the &ldquo;Sanspareil;&rdquo; and
some further time was allowed to get it repaired.&nbsp; The large
number of spectators who had assembled to witness the contest
were greatly disappointed at this postponement; but, to lessen
it, Stephenson again brought out the &ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; and,
attaching to it a coach containing thirty persons, he ran them
along the line at the rate of from 24 to 30 miles an hour, much
to their gratification and amazement.&nbsp; Before separating,
the judges ordered the engine to be in readiness by eight
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, to go through its
definitive trial according to the prescribed conditions.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th October, the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo;
was <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>again ready for the contest.&nbsp;
The engine was taken to the extremity of the stage, the fire-box
was filled with coke, the fire lighted, and the steam raised
until it lifted the safety-valve loaded to a pressure of 50
pounds to the square inch.&nbsp; This proceeding occupied
fifty-seven minutes.&nbsp; The engine then started on its
journey, dragging after it about 13 tons weight in waggons, and
made the first ten trips backwards and forwards along the two
miles of road, running the 35 miles, including stoppages, in one
hour and 48 minutes.&nbsp; The second ten trips were in like
manner performed in 2 hours and 3 minutes.&nbsp; The maximum
velocity attained during the trial trip was 29 miles an hour, or
about three times the speed that one of the judges of the
competition had declared to be the limit of possibility.&nbsp;
The average speed at which the whole of the journeys were
performed was 15 miles an hour, or 5 miles beyond the rate
specified in the conditions published by the Company.&nbsp; The
entire performance excited the greatest astonishment amongst the
assembled spectators; the directors felt confident that their
enterprise was now on the eve of success; and George Stephenson
rejoiced to think that in spite of all false prophets and fickle
counsellors, the locomotive system was now safe.&nbsp; When the
&ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; having performed all the conditions of the
contest, arrived at the &ldquo;grand stand&rdquo; at the close of
its day&rsquo;s successful run, Mr. Cropper&mdash;one of the
directors favourable to the fixed-engine system&mdash;lifted up
his hands, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Now has George Stephenson at
last delivered himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither the &ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; nor the
&ldquo;Sanspareil&rdquo; was ready for trial until the 10th, on
the morning of which day an advertisement appeared, stating that
the former engine was to be tried on that day, when it would
perform more work than any engine upon the ground.&nbsp; The
weight of the carriages attached to it was only about 7
tons.&nbsp; The engine passed the first post in good style; but
in returning, the pipe from the forcing-pump burst and put an end
to the trial.&nbsp; The pipe was afterwards repaired, and the
engine <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>made several trips by itself, in
which it was said to have gone at the rate of from 24 to 28 miles
an hour.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Sanspareil&rdquo; was not ready until the 13th; and
when its boiler and tender were filled with water, it was found
to weigh 4 cwt. beyond the weight specified in the published
conditions as the limit of four-wheeled engines; nevertheless the
judges allowed it to run on the same footing as the other
engines, to enable them to ascertain whether its merits entitled
it to favourable consideration.&nbsp; It travelled at the average
speed of about 14 miles an hour, with its load attached; but at
the eighth trip the cold-water pump got wrong, and the engine
could proceed no further.</p>
<p>It was determined to award the premium to the successful
engine on the following day, the 14th, on which occasion there
was an unusual assemblage of spectators.&nbsp; The owners of the
&ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; pleaded for another trial; and it was
conceded.&nbsp; But again it broke down.&nbsp; The owner of the
&ldquo;Sanspareil&rdquo; also requested the opportunity for
making another trial of his engine.&nbsp; But the judges had now
had enough of failures; and they declined, on the ground that not
only was the engine above the stipulated weight, but that it was
constructed on a plan which they could not recommend for adoption
by the directors of the Company.&nbsp; One of the principal
practical objections to this locomotive was the enormous quantity
of coke consumed or wasted by it&mdash;about 692 lbs. per hour
when travelling&mdash;caused by the sharpness of the steam-blast
in the chimney, which blew a large proportion of the burning coke
into the air.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Perseverance&rdquo; was found unable to move at
more than five or six miles an hour; and it was withdrawn from
the contest at an early period.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo;
was thus the only engine that had performed, and more than
performed, all the stipulated conditions; and its owners were
declared to be fully entitled to the prize of &pound;500, which
was awarded to the Messrs. Stephenson and Booth <!-- page
219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>accordingly.&nbsp; And further, to show that the engine
had been working quite within its powers, Mr. Stephenson ordered
it to be brought upon the ground and detached from all
incumbrances, when, in making two trips, it was found to travel
at the astonishing rate of 35 miles an hour.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; had thus eclipsed the performances of
all locomotive engines that had yet been constructed, and
outstripped even the sanguine expectations of its
constructors.&nbsp; It satisfactorily answered the report of
Messrs. Walker and Rastrick; and established the efficiency of
the locomotive for working the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,
and indeed all future railways.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo;
showed that a new power had been born into the world, full of
activity and strength, with boundless capability of work.&nbsp;
It was the simple but admirable contrivance of the steam-blast,
and its combination with the multitubular boiler, that at once
gave the locomotive a vigorous life, and secured the triumph of
the railway system. <a name="citation219"></a><a
href="#footnote219" class="citation">[219]</a>&nbsp; It has been
well observed, that this wonderful ability to increase and
multiply its powers of performance with the emergency that
demands them, has made this giant engine the noblest creation of
human wit, the very lion among machines.&nbsp; The success of the
Rainhill experiment, as judged by the public, may be inferred
from the fact that the shares of the Company immediately rose ten
per cent., and nothing more was heard of the proposed twenty-one
fixed engines, engine-houses, ropes, etc.&nbsp; All this
cumbersome apparatus was thenceforward effectually disposed
of.</p>
<p>Very different now was the tone of those directors who had
distinguished themselves by the persistency of their opposition
to Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; Coolness gave way to
eulogy, and hostility to unbounded offers of
friendship&mdash;after the manner of many men who run to the help
of the strong.&nbsp; Deeply though the engineer had felt
aggrieved by <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>the conduct pursued towards him
during this eventful struggle, by some from whom forbearance was
to have been expected, he never entertained towards them in after
life any angry feelings; on the contrary, he forgave all.&nbsp;
But though the directors afterwards passed unanimous resolutions
eulogising &ldquo;the great skill and unwearied energy&rdquo; of
their engineer, he himself, when speaking confidentially to those
with whom he was most intimate, could not help pointing out the
difference between his &ldquo;foul-weather and fair-weather
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gooch says of him that though naturally
most cheerful and kind-hearted in his disposition, the anxiety
and pressure which weighed upon his mind during the construction
of the railway, had the effect of making him occasionally
impatient and irritable, like a spirited horse touched by the
spur; though his original good-nature from time to time shone
through it all.&nbsp; When the line had been brought to a
successful completion, a very marked change in him became
visible.&nbsp; The irritability passed away, and when
difficulties and vexations arose they were treated by him as
matters of course, and with perfect composure and
cheerfulness.</p>

<span class="smcap">Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway</span>, <span class="smcap">and Extension of the Railway
System</span>.</h2>
<p>The directors of the Railway now began to see daylight; and
they derived encouragement from the skilful manner in which their
engineer had overcome the principal difficulties of the
undertaking.&nbsp; He had formed a solid road over Chat Moss, and
thus achieved one &ldquo;impossibility;&rdquo; and he had
constructed a locomotive that could run at a speed of 30 miles an
hour, thus vanquishing a still more formidable difficulty.</p>
<p>A single line of way was completed over Chat Moss by the 1st
of January, 1830; and on that day, the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; with
a carriage full of directors, engineers, and their friends,
passed along the greater part of the road between Liverpool and
Manchester.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson continued to direct his close
attention to the improvement of the details of the locomotive,
every successive trial of which proved more satisfactory.&nbsp;
In this department he had the benefit of the able and unremitting
assistance of his son, who, in the workshops at Newcastle,
directly superintended the construction of the new engines
required for the public working of the railway.&nbsp; He did not
by any means rest satisfied with the success, decided though it
was, which had been achieved by the &ldquo;Rocket.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He regarded it but in the light of a successful experiment; and
every succeeding engine placed upon the railway exhibited some
improvement on its predecessors.&nbsp; The arrangement of the
parts, and the weight and proportions of the engines, were
altered, as the experience of each successive day, or week, or
month, suggested; and it was soon found that the performances of
the <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; on the day of
trial had been greatly within the powers of the locomotive.</p>
<p>The first entire trip between Liverpool and Manchester was
performed on the 14th of June, 1830, on the occasion of a Board
meeting being held at the latter town.&nbsp; The train was on
this occasion drawn by the &ldquo;Arrow,&rdquo; one of the new
locomotives, in which the most recent improvements had been
adopted.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson himself drove the engine, and
Captain Scoresby, the circumpolar navigator, stood beside him on
the foot-plate, and minuted the speed of the train.&nbsp; A great
concourse of people assembled at both termini, as well as along
the line, to witness the novel spectacle of a train of carriages
dragged by an engine at a speed of 17 miles an hour.&nbsp; On the
return journey to Liverpool in the evening, the
&ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; crossed Chat Moss at a speed of nearly 27
miles an hour, reaching its destination in about an hour and a
half.</p>
<p>In the mean time Mr. Stephenson and his assistants were
diligently occupied in making the necessary preliminary
arrangements for the conduct of the traffic against the time when
the line should be ready for opening.&nbsp; The experiments made
with the object of carrying on the passenger traffic at quick
velocities were of an especially harassing and anxious
character.&nbsp; Every week, for nearly three months before the
opening, trial trips were made to Newton and back, generally with
two or three trains following each other, and carrying altogether
from 200 to 300 persons.&nbsp; These trips were usually made on
Saturday afternoons, when the works could be more conveniently
stopped and the line cleared.&nbsp; In these experiments Mr.
Stephenson had the able assistance of Mr. Henry Booth, the
secretary of the Company, who contrived many of the arrangements
in the rolling stock, not the least valuable of which was his
invention of the coupling screw, still in use on all passenger
railways.</p>
<p>At length the line was finished, and ready for the public
ceremony of the opening, which took place on the <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>15th September, 1830, and attracted a vast number of
spectators.&nbsp; The completion of the railway was justly
regarded as an important national event, and the opening was
celebrated accordingly.&nbsp; The Duke of Wellington, then Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Peel, and Mr. Huskisson, one of the members
for Liverpool, were among the number of distinguished public
personages present.</p>
<p>Eight locomotive engines, constructed at the Stephenson works,
had been delivered and placed upon the line, the whole of which
had been tried and tested weeks before, with perfect
success.&nbsp; The several trains of carriages accommodated in
all about six hundred persons.&nbsp; The procession was cheered
in its progress by thousands of spectators&mdash;through the deep
ravine of Olive Mount; up the Sutton incline; over the great
Sankey viaduct, beneath which a great multitude of persons had
assembled,&mdash;carriages filling the narrow lanes, and barges
crowding the river; the people below gazing with wonder and
admiration at the trains which sped along the line, far above
their heads, at the rate of some 24 miles an hour.</p>
<p>At Parkside, about 17 miles from Liverpool, the engines
stopped to take in water.&nbsp; Here a deplorable accident
occurred to one of the illustrious visitors, which threw a deep
shadow over the subsequent proceedings of the day.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Northumbrian&rdquo; engine, with the carriage containing
the Duke of Wellington, was drawn up on one line, in order that
the whole of the trains on the other line might pass in review
before him and his party.&nbsp; Mr. Huskisson had alighted from
the carriage, and was standing on the opposite road, along which
the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; was observed rapidly coming up.&nbsp; At
this moment the Duke of Wellington, between whom and Mr.
Huskisson some coolness had existed, made a sign of recognition,
and held out his hand.&nbsp; A hurried but friendly grasp was
given; and before it was loosened there was a general cry from
the bystanders of &ldquo;Get in, get in!&rdquo;&nbsp; Flurried
and confused, Mr. Huskisson endeavoured to get round the open
door of the carriage, <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>which projected over the opposite
rail; but in so doing he was struck down by the
&ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; and falling with his leg doubled across the
rail, the limb was instantly crushed.&nbsp; His first words, on
being raised, were, &ldquo;I have met my death,&rdquo; which
unhappily proved true, for he expired that same evening in the
parsonage of Eccles.&nbsp; It was cited at the time as a
remarkable fact, that the &ldquo;Northumbrian&rdquo; engine,
driven by George Stephenson himself, conveyed the wounded body of
the unfortunate gentleman a distance of about 15 miles in 25
minutes, or at the rate of 36 miles an hour.&nbsp; This
incredible speed burst upon the world with the effect of a new
and unlooked-for phenomenon.</p>
<p>The accident threw a gloom over the rest of the day&rsquo;s
proceedings.&nbsp; The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel
expressed a wish that the procession should return to
Liverpool.&nbsp; It was, however, represented to them that a vast
concourse of people had assembled at Manchester to witness the
arrival of the trains; that report would exaggerate the mischief,
if they did not complete the journey; and that a false panic on
that day might seriously affect future railway travelling and the
value of the Company&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; The party consented
accordingly to proceed to Manchester, but on the understanding
that they should return as soon as possible, and refrain from
further festivity.</p>
<p>As the trains approached Manchester, crowds of people were
found covering the banks, the slopes of the cuttings, and even
the railway itself.&nbsp; The multitude, become impatient and
excited by the rumours which reached them, had outflanked the
military, and all order was at an end.&nbsp; The people clambered
about the carriages, holding on by the door-handles, and many
were tumbled over; but, happily no fatal accident occurred.&nbsp;
At the Manchester station, the political element began to display
itself; placards about &ldquo;Peterloo,&rdquo; etc., were
exhibited, and brickbats were thrown at the carriage containing
the Duke.&nbsp; On the carriages coming to a stand in the
Manchester station the Duke did not descend, but remained seated,
shaking hands with the <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>women and
children who were pushed forward by the crowd.&nbsp; Shortly
after, the trains returned to Liverpool, which they reached,
after considerable interruptions, in the dark, at a late
hour.</p>
<p>On the following morning the railway was opened for public
traffic.&nbsp; The first train of 140 passengers was booked and
sent on to Manchester, reaching it in the allotted period of two
hours; and from that time the traffic has regularly proceeded
from day to day until now.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary that we should speak at any length of
the commercial results of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that its success was complete
and decisive.&nbsp; The anticipations of its projectors were,
however, in many respects at fault.&nbsp; They had based their
calculations almost entirely on the heavy merchandise
traffic&mdash;such as coal, cotton, and timber,&mdash;relying
little upon passengers; whereas the receipts derived from the
conveyance of passengers far exceeded those derived from
merchandise of all kinds, which, for a time continued a
subordinate branch of the traffic.</p>
<p>For some time after the public opening of the line, Mr.
Stephenson&rsquo;s ingenuity continued to be employed in devising
improved methods for securing the safety and comfort of the
travelling public.&nbsp; Few are aware of the thousand minute
details which have to be arranged&mdash;the forethought and
contrivance that have to be exercised&mdash;to enable the
traveller by railway to accomplish his journey in safety.&nbsp;
After the difficulties of constructing a level road over bogs,
across valleys, and through deep cuttings, have been overcome,
the maintenance of the way has to be provided for with continuous
care.&nbsp; Every rail with its fastenings must be complete, to
prevent risk of accident; and the road must be kept regularly
ballasted up to the level, to diminish the jolting of vehicles
passing over it at high speeds.&nbsp; Then the stations must be
protected by signals observable from such a distance as to enable
the train to be stopped in event of an obstacle, such as a
stopping or shunting train being in the <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>way.&nbsp;
For some years the signals employed on the Liverpool railway were
entirely given by men with flags of different colours stationed
along the line; there were no fixed signals, nor electric
telegraphs; but the traffic was nevertheless worked quite as
safely as under the more elaborate and complicated system of
telegraphing which has since been established.</p>
<p>From an early period it became obvious that the iron road as
originally laid down was far too weak for the heavy traffic which
it had to carry.&nbsp; The line was at first laid with
fish-bellied rails weighing thirty-five pounds to the yard,
calculated only for horse-traffic, or, at most, for engines like
the &ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; of very light weight.&nbsp; But as the
power and the weight of the locomotives were increased, it was
found that such rails were quite insufficient for the safe
conduct of the traffic, and it therefore became necessary to
re-lay the road with heavier and stronger rails at considerably
increased expense.</p>
<p>The details of the carrying stock had in like manner to be
settled by experience.&nbsp; Everything had, as it were, to be
begun from the beginning.&nbsp; The coal-waggon, it is true,
served in some degree as a model for the railway-truck; but the
railway passenger-carriage was an entirely novel structure.&nbsp;
It had to be mounted upon strong framing, of a peculiar kind,
supported on springs to prevent jolting.&nbsp; Then there was the
necessity for contriving some method of preventing hard bumping
of the carriage-ends when the train was pulled up; and hence the
contrivance of buffer-springs and spring frames.&nbsp; For the
purpose of stopping the train, brakes on an improved plan were
also contrived, with new modes of lubricating the carriage-axles,
on which the wheels revolved at an unusually high velocity.&nbsp;
In all these arrangements, Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s inventiveness
was kept constantly on the stretch; and though many improvements
in detail have been effected since his time, the foundations were
then laid by him of the present system of conducting railway
traffic.&nbsp; As an illustration of the inventive <!-- page
227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>ingenuity which he displayed in providing for the
working of the Liverpool line, we may mention his contrivance of
the Self-acting Brake.&nbsp; He early entertained the idea that
the momentum of the running train might itself be made available
for the purpose of checking its speed.&nbsp; He proposed to fit
each carriage with a brake which should be called into action
immediately on the locomotive at the head of the train being
pulled up.&nbsp; The impetus of the carriages carrying them
forward, the buffer-springs would be driven home and, at the same
time, by a simple arrangement of the mechanism, the brakes would
be called into simultaneous action; thus the wheels would be
brought into a state of sledge, and the train speedily
stopped.&nbsp; This plan was adopted by Mr. Stephenson before he
left the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, though it was
afterwards discontinued; but it is a remarkable fact, that this
identical plan, with the addition of a centrifugal apparatus, has
quite recently been revived by M. Gu&eacute;rin, a French
engineer, and extensively employed on foreign railways, as the
best method of stopping railway trains in the most efficient
manner and in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Stephenson had to attend to the improvement of
the power and speed of the locomotive&mdash;always the grand
object of his study,&mdash;with a view to economy as well as
regularity of working.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Planet&rdquo; engine,
delivered upon the line immediately subsequent to the public
opening, all the improvements which had up to that time been
contrived by him and his son were introduced in
combination&mdash;the blast-pipe, the tubular boiler, horizontal
cylinders inside the smoke-box, the cranked axle, and the
fire-box firmly fixed to the boiler.&nbsp; The first load of
goods conveyed from Liverpool to Manchester by the
&ldquo;Planet&rdquo; was 80 tons in weight, and the engine
performed the journey against a strong head wind in 2&frac12;
hours.&nbsp; On another occasion, the same engine brought up a
cargo of voters from Manchester to Liverpool, during a contested
election, within a space of sixty minutes!&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; delivered in the following <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>year, exhibited still further improvements, the most
important of which was that of <i>coupling</i> the fore and hind
wheels of the engine.&nbsp; By this means, the adhesion of the
wheels on the rails was more effectually secured, and thus the
full hauling power of the locomotive was made available.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; shortly after it was placed upon the
line, dragged after it a train of waggons weighing 150 tons at a
speed of about 20 miles an hour; the consumption of coke being
reduced to only about a third of a pound per ton per mile.</p>
<p>The success of the Liverpool and Manchester experiment
naturally excited great interest.&nbsp; People flocked to
Lancashire from all quarters to see the steam-coach running upon
a railway at three times the speed of a mailcoach, and to enjoy
the excitement of actually travelling in the wake of an engine at
that incredible velocity.&nbsp; The travellers returned to their
respective districts full of the wonders of the locomotive,
considering it to be the greatest marvel of the age.&nbsp;
Railways are familiar enough objects now, and our children who
grow up in their midst may think little of them; but thirty years
since it was an event in one&rsquo;s life to see a locomotive,
and to travel for the first time upon a public railroad.</p>
<p>The practicability of railway locomotion being now proved, and
its great social and commercial advantages ascertained, the
general extension of the system was merely a question of time,
money, and labour.&nbsp; Although the legislature took no
initiative step in the direction of railway extension, the public
spirit and enterprise of the country did not fail it at this
juncture.&nbsp; The English people, though they may be defective
in their capacity for organization, are strong in individualism;
and not improbably their admirable qualities in the latter
respect detract from their efficiency in the former.&nbsp; Thus,
in all times, their greatest enterprises have not been planned by
officialism and carried out upon any regular system, but have
sprung, like their constitution, their laws, and their entire
industrial arrangements, from <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>the force
of circumstances and the individual energies of the people.</p>
<p>The mode of action in the case of railway extension, was
characteristic and national.&nbsp; The execution of the new lines
was undertaken entirely by joint-stock associations of
proprietors, after the manner of the Stockton and Darlington, and
Liverpool and Manchester companies.&nbsp; These associations are
conformable to our national habits, and fit well into our system
of laws.&nbsp; They combine the power of vast resources with
individual watchfulness and motives of self-interest; and by
their means gigantic undertakings, which otherwise would be
impossible to any but kings and emperors with great national
resources at command, were carried out by the co-operation of
private persons.&nbsp; And the results of this combination of
means and of enterprise have been truly marvellous.&nbsp; Within
the life of the present generation, the private citizens of
England engaged in railway extension have, in the face of
Government obstructions, and without taking a penny from the
public purse, executed a system of communications involving works
of the most gigantic kind, which, in their total mass, their
cost, and their public utility, far exceed the most famous
national undertakings of any age or country.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson was of course, actively engaged in the
construction of the numerous railways now projected by the
joint-stock companies.&nbsp; The desire for railway extension
principally pervaded the manufacturing districts, especially
after the successful opening of the Liverpool and Manchester
line.&nbsp; The commercial classes of the larger towns soon
became eager for a participation in the good which they had so
recently derided.&nbsp; Railway projects were set on foot in
great numbers, and Manchester became a centre from which main
lines and branches were started in all directions.&nbsp; The
interest, however, which attaches to these later schemes is of a
much less absorbing kind than that which belongs to the earlier
history of the railway and the steps by which it was mainly
established.&nbsp; We naturally sympathise more <!-- page
230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>keenly with the early struggles of a great principle,
its trials and its difficulties, than with its after stages of
success; and, however gratified and astonished we may be at its
consequences, the interest is in a great measure gone when its
triumph has become a matter of certainty.</p>
<p>The commercial results of the Liverpool and Manchester line
were so satisfactory, and indeed so greatly exceeded the
expectations of its projectors, that many of the abandoned
projects of the speculative year 1825 were forthwith
revived.&nbsp; An abundant crop of engineers sprang up, ready to
execute railways of any extent.&nbsp; Now that the Liverpool and
Manchester line had been made, and the practicability of working
it by locomotive power had been proved, it was as easy for
engineers to make railways and to work them, as it was for
navigators to find America after Columbus had made the first
voyage.&nbsp; Mr. Francis Giles attached himself to the Newcastle
and Carlisle and London and Southampton projects.&nbsp; Mr.
Brunel appeared as engineer of the line projected between London
and Bristol; and Mr. Braithwaite, the builder of the
&ldquo;Novelty&rdquo; engine, acted in the same capacity for a
railway from London to Colchester.</p>
<p>The first lines constructed subsequent to the opening of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, were mostly in connection with
it, and principally in the county of Lancaster.&nbsp; Thus a
branch was formed from Bolton to Leigh, and another from Leigh to
Kenyon, where it formed a junction with the main line between
Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; Branches to Wigan on the north,
and to Runcorn Gap and Warrington on the south of the same line,
were also formed.&nbsp; A continuation of the latter, as far
south as Birmingham, was shortly after projected under the name
of the Grand Junction Railway.</p>
<p>The last mentioned line was projected as early as the year
1824, when the Liverpool and Manchester scheme was under
discussion, and Mr. Stephenson then published a report on the
subject.&nbsp; The plans were deposited, but the bill was thrown
out through the opposition of the landowners <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>and canal
proprietors.&nbsp; When engaged in making the survey, Stephenson
called upon some of the landowners in the neighbourhood of
Nantwich to obtain their assent, and was greatly disgusted to
learn that the agents of the canal companies had been before him,
and described the locomotive to the farmers as a most frightful
machine, emitting a breath as poisonous as the fabled dragon of
old; and telling them that if a bird flew over the district where
one of these engines passed, it would inevitably drop down
dead!&nbsp; The application for the bill was renewed in 1826, and
again failed; and at length it was determined to wait the issue
of the Liverpool and Manchester experiment.&nbsp; The act was
eventually obtained in 1833.</p>
<p>When it was proposed to extend the advantages of railways to
the population of the midland and southern counties of England,
an immense amount of alarm was created in the minds of the
country gentlemen.&nbsp; They did not relish the idea of private
individuals, principally resident in the manufacturing districts,
invading their domains; and they everywhere rose up in arms
against the &ldquo;new-fangled roads.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel
Sibthorpe openly declared his hatred of the &ldquo;infernal
railroads,&rdquo; and said that he &ldquo;would rather meet a
highwayman, or see a burglar on his premises, than an
engineer!&rdquo;&nbsp; The impression which prevailed in the
rural districts was, that fox-covers and game-preserves would be
seriously prejudiced by the formation of railroads; that
agricultural communications would be destroyed, land thrown out
of cultivation, landowners and farmers reduced to beggary, the
poor-rates increased through the number of persons thrown out of
employment by the railways,&mdash;and all this in order that
Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham shopkeepers and
manufacturers might establish a monstrous monopoly in railway
traffic.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of even some of the large towns were thrown
into a state of consternation by the proposal to provide them
with the accommodation of a railway.&nbsp; The line from London
to Birmingham would naturally have passed <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>close to
the handsome town of Northampton, and was so projected; but the
inhabitants of the shire, urged on by the local press, and
excited by men of influence and education, opposed the project,
and succeeded in forcing the promoters, in their survey of the
line, to pass the town at a distance.&nbsp; When the first
railway through Kent was projected, the line was laid out so as
to pass by Maidstone, the county town.&nbsp; But it had not a
single supporter amongst the townspeople, whilst the landowners
for many miles round combined to oppose it.&nbsp; In like manner,
the line projected from London to Bristol was strongly denounced
by the inhabitants of the intermediate districts; and when the
first bill was thrown out, Eton assembled under the presidency of
the Marquis of Chandos to congratulate the country upon its
defeat.</p>
<p>During the time that the works of the Liverpool and Manchester
line were in progress, our engineer was consulted respecting a
short railway proposed to be formed between Leicester and
Swannington, for the purpose of opening up a communication
between the town of Leicester and the coal-fields in the western
part of the county.&nbsp; The projector of this undertaking had
some difficulty in getting the requisite capital subscribed for,
the Leicester townspeople who had money being for the most part
interested in canals.&nbsp; George Stephenson was invited to come
upon the ground and survey the line.&nbsp; He did so, and then
the projector told him of the difficulty he had in finding
subscribers to the concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me a sheet,&rdquo;
said Stephenson, &ldquo;and I will raise the money for you in
Liverpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; The engineer was as good as his word, and
in a short time the sheet was returned with the subscription
complete.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson was then asked to undertake the
office of engineer for the line, but his answer was that he had
thirty miles of railway in hand, which were enough for any
engineer to attend to properly.&nbsp; Was there any person he
could recommend?&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
think my son Robert is competent to undertake the
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would Mr. <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Stephenson
be answerable for him?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,
certainly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Robert Stephenson, at twenty-seven
years of age, was installed engineer of the line accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The requisite Parliamentary powers having been obtained,
Robert Stephenson proceeded with the construction of the railway,
about 16 miles in length, towards the end of 1830.&nbsp; The
works were comparatively easy, excepting at the Leicester end,
where the young engineer encountered his first stiff bit of
tunnelling.&nbsp; The line passed underground for 1&frac34; mile,
and 500 yards of its course lay in loose dry running sand.&nbsp;
The presence of this material rendered it necessary for the
engineer first to construct a wooden tunnel to support the soil
while the brickwork was being executed.&nbsp; This proved
sufficient, and the whole was brought to a successful termination
within a reasonable time.&nbsp; While the works were in progress,
Robert kept up a regular correspondence with his father at
Liverpool, consulting him on all points in which his greater
experience was likely to be of service.&nbsp; Like his father,
Robert was very observant, and always ready to seize opportunity
by the forelock.&nbsp; It happened that the estate of Snibston,
near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, was advertised for sale; and the young
engineer&rsquo;s experience as <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>a
coal-viewer and practical geologist suggested to his mind that
coal was most probably to be found underneath.&nbsp; He
communicated his views to his father on the subject.&nbsp; The
estate lay in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway; and if
the conjecture proved correct, the finding of coal would
necessarily greatly enhance its value.&nbsp; He accordingly
requested his father to come over to Snibston and look at the
property, which he did; and after a careful inspection of the
ground, he arrived at the same conclusion as his son.</p>
<p>The large manufacturing town of Leicester, about fourteen
miles distant, had up to that time been exclusively supplied with
coal brought by canal from Derbyshire; and Mr. Stephenson saw
that the railway under construction from Swannington to
Leicester, would furnish him with a ready market for any coals
which he might find at Snibston.&nbsp; Having induced two of his
Liverpool friends to join him in the venture, the Snibston estate
was purchased in 1831: and shortly after, Stephenson removed his
home from Liverpool to Alton Grange, for the purpose of
superintending the sinking of the pit.&nbsp; He travelled thither
by gig with his wife,&mdash;his favourite horse
&ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; performing the journey by easy stages.</p>
<p>Sinking operations were immediately begun, and proceeded
satisfactorily until the old enemy, water, burst in upon the
workmen, and threatened to drown them out.&nbsp; But by means of
efficient pumping-engines, and the skilful casing of the shaft
with segments of cast-iron&mdash;a process called
&ldquo;tubbing,&rdquo; <a name="citation234"></a><a
href="#footnote234" class="citation">[234]</a> which Mr.
Stephenson was the first to adopt in the Midland
Counties&mdash;it was eventually made water-tight, and the
sinking proceeded.&nbsp; When a depth of <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>166 feet
had been reached, a still more formidable difficulty presented
itself&mdash;one which had baffled former sinkers in the
neighbourhood, and deterred them from further operations.&nbsp;
This was a remarkable bed of whinstone or green-stone, which had
originally been poured out as a sheet of burning lava over the
denuded surface of the coal measures; indeed it was afterwards
found that it had turned to cinders one part of the seam of coal
with which it had come in contact.&nbsp; The appearance of this
bed of solid rock was so unusual a circumstance in coal mining,
that some experienced sinkers urged Stephenson to proceed no
further, believing the occurrence of the dyke at that point to be
altogether fatal to his enterprise.&nbsp; But, with his faith
still firm in the existence of coal underneath, he fell back on
his old motto of &ldquo;Persevere.&rdquo;&nbsp; He determined to
go on boring; and down through the solid rock he went until,
twenty-two feet lower, he came upon the coal measures.&nbsp; In
the mean time, however, lest the boring at that point should
prove unsuccessful, he had commenced sinking another pair of
shafts about a quarter of a mile west of the &ldquo;fault;&rdquo;
and after about nine months&rsquo; labour he reached the
principal seam, called the &ldquo;main coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The works were then opened out on a large scale, and Mr.
Stephenson had the pleasure and good fortune to send the first
train of main coal to Leicester by railway.&nbsp; The price was
immediately reduced to about 8s. a ton, effecting a pecuniary
saving to the inhabitants of the town of about &pound;40,000 per
annum, or equivalent to the whole amount then collected in
Government taxes and local rates, besides giving an impetus to
the manufacturing prosperity of the place, which has continued
down to the present day.&nbsp; The correct principles upon which
the mining operations at Snibston were conducted offered a
salutary example to the neighbouring colliery owners.&nbsp; The
numerous improvements there introduced were freely exhibited to
all, and they were afterwards reproduced in many forms all over
the Midland Counties, greatly to the advantage of the mining
interest.</p>
<p><!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>Nor was Mr. Stephenson less attentive to the comfort
and well-being of those immediately dependent upon him&mdash;the
workpeople of the Snibston colliery and their families.&nbsp;
Unlike many of those large employers who have &ldquo;sprung from
the ranks,&rdquo; he was one of the kindest and most indulgent of
masters.&nbsp; He would have a fair day&rsquo;s work for a fair
day&rsquo;s wages; but he never forgot that the employer had his
duties as well as his rights.&nbsp; First of all, he attended to
the proper home accommodation of his workpeople.&nbsp; He erected
a village of comfortable cottages, each provided with a snug
little garden.&nbsp; He was also instrumental in erecting a
church adjacent to the works, as well as Church schools for the
education of the colliers&rsquo; children; and with that broad
catholicity of sentiment which distinguished him, he further
provided a chapel and a school-house for the use of the
Dissenting portion of the colliers and their families&mdash;an
example of benevolent liberality which was not without a salutary
influence upon the neighbouring employers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Robert Stephenson constructs the London and
Birmingham Railway</span>.</h2>
<p>Of the numerous extensive projects which followed close upon
the completion of the Liverpool and Manchester line, and the
Locomotive triumph at Rainhill, that of a railway between London
and Birmingham was the most important.&nbsp; The scheme
originated at the latter place in 1830.&nbsp; Two committees were
formed, and two plans were proposed.&nbsp; One was of a line to
London by way of Oxford, and the other by way of Coventry.&nbsp;
The simple object of the promoters of both schemes being to
secure the advantages of railway communication with the
metropolis, they wisely determined to combine their strength to
secure it.&nbsp; They then resolved to call George Stephenson to
their aid, and requested him to advise them as to the two schemes
which were before them.&nbsp; After a careful examination of the
country, Mr. Stephenson reported in favour of the Coventry route,
when the Lancashire gentlemen, who were the principal subscribers
to the project, having every confidence in his judgment,
supported his decision, and the line recommended by him was
adopted accordingly.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the promoters held at Birmingham to
determine on the appointment of the engineer for the railway,
there was a strong party in favour of associating with Mr.
Stephenson a gentleman with whom he had been brought into serious
collision in the course of the Liverpool and Manchester
undertaking.&nbsp; When the offer was made to him that he should
be joint engineer with the other, he requested leave to retire
and consider the proposal with his son.&nbsp; The father was in
favour of accepting it.&nbsp; His struggle heretofore had been so
hard that he could not bear the <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>idea of
missing so promising an opportunity of professional
advancement.&nbsp; But the son, foreseeing the jealousies and
heartburnings which the joint engineership would most probably
create, recommended his father to decline the connection.&nbsp;
George adopted the suggestion, and returning to the Committee, he
announced to them his decision; on which the promoters decided to
appoint him the engineer of the undertaking in conjunction with
his son.</p>
<p>This line, like the Liverpool and Manchester, was very
strongly opposed, especially by the landowners.&nbsp; Numerous
pamphlets were published, calling on the public to &ldquo;beware
of the bubbles,&rdquo; and holding up the promoters of railways
to ridicule.&nbsp; They were compared to St. John Long and
similar quacks, and pronounced fitter for Bedlam than to be left
at large.&nbsp; The canal proprietors, landowners, and road
trustees, made common cause against them.&nbsp; The failure of
railways was confidently predicted&mdash;indeed, it was
elaborately attempted to be proved that they had failed; and it
was industriously spread abroad that the locomotive engines,
having been found useless and highly dangerous on the Liverpool
and Manchester line, were immediately to be abandoned in favour
of horses&mdash;a rumour which the directors of the Company
thought it necessary publicly to contradict.</p>
<p>Public meetings were held in all the counties through which
the line would pass between London and Birmingham, at which the
project was denounced, and strong resolutions against it were
passed.&nbsp; The attempt was made to conciliate the landlords by
explanations, but all such efforts proved futile, the owners of
nearly seven-eighths of the land being returned as
dissentients.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Robert
Stephenson, describing the opposition, &ldquo;that we called one
day on Sir Astley Cooper, the eminent surgeon, in the hope of
overcoming his aversion to the railway.&nbsp; He was one of our
most inveterate and influential opponents.&nbsp; His country
house at Berkhampstead was situated near the intended line, which
passed through part of his property.&nbsp; We found a courtly,
fine-looking old gentleman, of very <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>stately
manners, who received us kindly and heard all we had to say in
favour of the project.&nbsp; But he was quite inflexible in his
opposition to it.&nbsp; No deviation or improvement that we could
suggest had any effect in conciliating him.&nbsp; He was opposed
to railways generally, and to this in particular.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your scheme,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is preposterous in the
extreme.&nbsp; It is of so extravagant a character, as to be
positively absurd.&nbsp; Then look at the recklessness of your
proceedings!&nbsp; You are proposing to cut up our estates in all
directions for the purpose of making an unnecessary road.&nbsp;
Do you think for one moment of the destruction of property
involved by it?&nbsp; Why, gentlemen, if this sort of thing be
permitted to go on, you will in a very few years <i>destroy the
noblesse</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; We left the honourable baronet without
having produced the slightest effect upon him, excepting perhaps,
it might be, increased exasperation against our scheme.&nbsp; 1
could not help observing to my companions as we left the house,
&lsquo;Well, it is really provoking to find one who has been made
a &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; for cutting that wen out of George the
Fourth&rsquo;s neck, charging us with contemplating the
destruction of the <i>noblesse</i>, because we propose to confer
upon him the benefits of a railroad.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Such being the opposition of the owners of land, it was with
the greatest difficulty that an accurate survey of the line could
be made.&nbsp; At one point the vigilance of the landowners and
their servants was such, that the surveyors were effectually
prevented taking the levels by the light of day; and it was only
at length accomplished at night by means of dark lanterns.&nbsp;
There was one clergyman, who made such alarming demonstrations of
his opposition, that the extraordinary expedient was resorted to
of surveying his property during the time he was engaged in the
pulpit.&nbsp; This was managed by having a strong force of
surveyors in readiness to commence their operations, who entered
the clergyman&rsquo;s grounds on one side the moment they saw him
fairly off them on the other.&nbsp; By a well-organised and
systematic arrangement each man concluded his allotted <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>task just as the reverend gentleman concluded his
sermon; so that, before he left the church, the deed was done,
and the sinners had all decamped.&nbsp; Similar opposition was
offered at many other points, but ineffectually.&nbsp; The
laborious application of Robert Stephenson was such, that in
examining the country to ascertain the best line, he walked the
whole distance between London and Birmingham upwards of twenty
times.</p>
<p>When the bill went before the Committee of the Commons in
1832, a formidable array of evidence was produced.&nbsp; All the
railway experience of the day was brought to bear in support of
the measure, and all that interested opposition could do was set
in motion against it.&nbsp; The necessity for an improved mode of
communication between London and Birmingham was clearly
demonstrated; and the engineering evidence was regarded as quite
satisfactory.&nbsp; Not a single fact was proved against the
utility of the measure, and the bill passed the Committee, and
afterwards the third reading in the Commons, by large
majorities.</p>
<p>It was then sent to the Lords, and went into Committee, when a
similar mass of testimony was again gone through.&nbsp; But it
had been evident, from the opening of the proceedings, that the
fate of the bill had been determined before even a word of the
evidence had been heard.&nbsp; At that time the committees were
open to all peers; and the promoters of the bill found, to their
dismay, many of the lords who were avowed opponents of the
measure as landowners, sitting as judges to decide its
fate.&nbsp; Their principal object seemed to be, to bring the
proceedings to a termination as quickly as possible.&nbsp; An
attempt at negotiation was indeed made in the course of the
proceedings in committee, but failed, and the bill was thrown
out.</p>
<p>As the result had been foreseen, measures were taken to
neutralise the effect of this decision as regarded future
operations.&nbsp; Not less than &pound;32,000 had been expended
in preliminary and parliamentary expenses up to this stage; but
the promoters determined not to look back, and <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>forthwith
made arrangements for prosecuting the bill in the next
session.&nbsp; Strange to say, the bill then passed both Houses
silently and almost without opposition.&nbsp; The mystery was
afterwards solved by the appearance of a circular issued by the
directors of the company, in which it was stated, that they had
opened &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo; with the most influential of
their opponents; that &ldquo;these measures had been successful
to a greater extent than they had ventured to anticipate; and the
most active and formidable had been conciliated.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
instructive commentary on the mode by which these noble lords and
influential landed proprietors had been
&ldquo;conciliated,&rdquo; was the simple fact that the estimate
for land was nearly trebled, and that the owners were paid about
&pound;750,000 for what had been originally estimated at
&pound;250,000.</p>
<p>The landowners having thus been &ldquo;conciliated,&rdquo; the
promoters of the measure were permitted to proceed with the
formation of their great highway.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson was,
with the sanction of his father, appointed sole engineer; and
steps were at once taken by him to make the working survey, to
prepare the working drawings, and arrange for the construction of
the railway.&nbsp; Eighty miles of the road were shortly under
contract, having been let within the estimates; and the works
were in satisfactory progress by the beginning of 1834.</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered in their construction were very
great; the most formidable of them originating in the character
of the works themselves.&nbsp; Extensive tunnels had to be driven
through unknown strata, and miles of underground excavation had
to be carried out in order to form a level road from valley to
valley, under the intervening ridges.&nbsp; This kind of work was
the newest of all to the contractors of that day.&nbsp; Robert
Stephenson&rsquo;s experience in the collieries of the North
rendered him well fitted to grapple with such difficulties; yet
even he, with all his practical knowledge, could scarcely have
foreseen the serious obstacles which he was called upon to
encounter in executing <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the
formidable cuttings, embankments, and tunnels of the London and
Birmingham Railway.&nbsp; It would be an uninteresting, as it
would be a fruitless task, to attempt to describe the works in
detail; but a general outline of their extraordinary character
and extent may not be out of place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p242.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>The length of railway to be constructed between London and
Birmingham was 112&frac12; miles.&nbsp; The line crossed a series
of low-lying districts separated from each other by considerable
ridges of hills; and it was the object of the engineer to cross
the valleys at as high, and the hills at as low, elevations as
possible.&nbsp; The high ground was therefore cut down and the
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; led into embankments, in some places of great
height and extent, so as to form a road upon as level a plane as
was considered practicable for the working of the locomotive
engine.&nbsp; In some places, the high grounds were passed in
open cuttings, whilst in others it was necessary to bore through
them in tunnels with deep cuttings at each end.</p>
<p>The most formidable excavations on the line are those at
Tring, Denbigh Hall, and Blisworth.&nbsp; The Tring cutting is an
immense chasm across the great chalk ridge of Ivinghoe.&nbsp; It
is 2&frac12; miles long, and for &frac14; of a mile is 57 feet
deep.&nbsp; A million and a half cubic yards of chalk and earth
were taken out of this cutting by means of horse-runs and <!--
page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>deposited in spoil banks; besides the immense quantity
run into the embankment north of the cutting, forming a solid
mound nearly 6 miles long and about 30 feet high.&nbsp; Passing
over the Denbigh Hall cutting, and the Wolverton embankment of
1&frac12; mile in length across the valley of the Ouse, we come
to the excavation at Blisworth, a brief description of which will
give the reader an idea of one of the most difficult kinds of
railway work.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Blisworth Cutting is one of the longest and deepest
grooves cut in the solid earth.&nbsp; It is 1&frac12; mile long,
in some places 65 feet deep, passing through earth, stiff clay,
and hard rock.&nbsp; Not less than a million cubic yards of these
materials were dug, quarried, and blasted out of it.&nbsp;
One-third of the cutting was stone, and beneath the stone lay a
<!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>thick bed of clay, under which were found beds of loose
shale so full of water that almost constant pumping was necessary
at many points to enable the works to proceed.&nbsp; For a year
and a half the contractor went on fruitlessly contending with
these difficulties, and at length he was compelled to abandon the
adventure.&nbsp; The engineer then took the works in hand for the
Company, and they were vigorously proceeded with.&nbsp;
Steam-engines were set to work to pump out the water; two
locomotives were put on, one at each end of the cutting, to drag
away the excavated rock and clay; and 800 men and boys were
employed along the work, in digging, wheeling, and blasting,
besides a large number of horses.&nbsp; Some idea of the extent
of the blasting operations may be formed from the fact that 25
barrels of gunpowder were used weekly; the total quantity
exploded in forming this one cutting being about 3,000
barrels.&nbsp; Considerable difficulty was experienced in
supporting the bed of rock cut through, which overlaid the clay
and shale along each side of the cutting.&nbsp; It was found
necessary to hold it up by strong retaining walls, to prevent the
clay bed from bulging out, and these walls were further supported
by a strong invert,&mdash;that is, an arch placed in an inverted
position under the road,&mdash;thus binding together the walls on
both sides.&nbsp; Behind the retaining walls, a drift or
horizontal drain was provided to enable the water to run off, and
occasional openings were left in the walls themselves for the
same purpose.&nbsp; The work was at length brought to a
successful completion, but the extraordinary difficulties
encountered in forming the cutting had the effect of greatly
increasing the cost of this portion of the railway.</p>
<p>The Tunnels on the line are eight in number, their total
length being 7336 yards.&nbsp; The first high ground encountered
was Primrose Hill, where the stiff London clay was passed through
for a distance of about 1164 yards.&nbsp; The clay was close,
compact, and dry, more difficult to work than stone itself.&nbsp;
It was entirely free from water; but the absorbing properties of
the clay were such that when <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>exposed to
the air it swelled out rapidly.&nbsp; Hence an unusual thickness
of brick lining was found necessary; and the engineer afterwards
informed the author that for some time he entertained an
apprehension lest the pressure should force in the brickwork
altogether.&nbsp; It was so great that it made the face of the
bricks to fly off in minute chips which covered his clothes
whilst he was inspecting the work.&nbsp; The materials used in
the building were, however, of excellent quality; and the tunnel
was happily brought to a completion without any accident.</p>
<p>At Watford the chalk ridge was penetrated by a tunnel about
1800 yards long; and at Northchurch, Lindslade, and Stowe Hill,
there were other tunnels of minor extent.&nbsp; But the chief
difficulty of the undertaking was the execution of that under the
Kilsby ridge.&nbsp; Though not the largest, this is in many
respects one of the most interesting works of the kind in
England.&nbsp; It is about 2400 yards long, and runs at an
average depth of about 160 feet below the surface.&nbsp; The
ridge under which it extends is of considerable extent, the
famous battle of Naseby having been fought upon one of the spurs
of the same high ground about seven miles to the eastward.</p>
<p>Previous to the letting of the contract, the character of the
underground soil was examined by trial-shafts.&nbsp; The tests
indicated that it consisted of shale of the lower oolite, and the
works were let accordingly.&nbsp; But they had scarcely been
commenced when it was discovered that, at an interval between the
two trial-shafts which had been sunk, about 200 yards from the
south end of the tunnel, there existed an extensive quicksand
under a bed of clay 40 feet thick, which the borings had escaped
in the most singular manner.&nbsp; At the bottom of one of these
shafts the excavation and building of the tunnel were proceeding,
when the roof at one part suddenly gave way, a deluge of water
burst in, and the party of workmen with the utmost difficulty
escaped with their lives.&nbsp; They were only saved by means of
a raft, on which they were towed by one of the engineers <!--
page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>swimming with the rope in his mouth to the lower end of
the shaft, out of which they were safely lifted to the
daylight.&nbsp; The works were of course at that point
immediately stopped.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The contractor, who had undertaken the construction of the
tunnel, was so overwhelmed by the calamity, that, though he was
relieved by the Company from his engagement, he took to his bed
and shortly after died.&nbsp; Pumping-engines were then erected
for the purpose of draining off the water, but for a long time it
prevailed, and sometimes even rose in the shaft.&nbsp; The
question then presented itself, whether in the face of so
formidable a difficulty, the works should be proceeded with or
abandoned.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson sent over to Alton Grange for
his father, and the two took serious counsel together.&nbsp;
George was in favour of <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>pumping out
the water from the top by powerful engines erected over each
shaft, until the water was mastered.&nbsp; Robert concurred in
that view, and although other engineers pronounced strongly
against the practicability of the scheme and advised its
abandonment, the directors authorised him to proceed; and
powerful steam-engines were ordered to be constructed and
delivered without loss of time.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Robert suggested to his father the
expediency of running a drift along the heading from the south
end of the tunnel, with the view of draining off the water in
that way.&nbsp; George said he thought it would scarcely answer,
but that it was worth a trial, at all events until the
pumping-engines were got ready.&nbsp; Robert accordingly gave
orders for the drift to be proceeded with.&nbsp; The excavators
were immediately set to work; and they were very soon close upon
the sand bed.&nbsp; One day, when the engineer, his assistants,
and the workmen were clustered about the open entrance of the
drift-way, they heard a sudden roar as of distant thunder.&nbsp;
It was hoped that the water had burst in&mdash;for all the
workmen were out of the drift,&mdash;and that the sand bed would
now drain itself off in a natural way.&nbsp; Instead of which,
very little water made its appearance; and on examining the inner
end of the drift, it was found that the loud noise had been
caused by the sudden discharge into it of an immense mass of
sand, which had completely choked up the passage, and prevented
the water from flowing away.</p>
<p>The engineer now found that there was nothing for it but to
sink numerous additional shafts over the line of the tunnel at
the points at which it crossed the quicksand, and endeavour to
master the water by sheer force of engines and pumps.&nbsp; The
engines erected, possessed an aggregate power of 160 horses; and
they went on pumping for eight successive months, emptying out an
almost incredible quantity of water.&nbsp; It was found that the
water, with which the bed of sand extending over many miles was
charged, was to a certain degree held back by the particles of
the sand <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>itself, and that it could only
percolate through at a certain average rate.&nbsp; It appeared in
its flow to take a slanting direction to the suction of the
pumps, the angle of inclination depending upon the coarseness or
fineness of the sand, and regulating the time of the flow.&nbsp;
Hence the distribution of the pumping power at short intervals
along the line of the tunnel had a much greater effect than the
concentration of that power at any one spot.&nbsp; It soon
appeared that the water had found its master.&nbsp; Protected by
the pumps, which cleared a space for the engineering
operations&mdash;carried on in the midst, as it were, of two
almost perpendicular walls of water and sand on either
side&mdash;the workmen proceeded with the building of the tunnel
at numerous points.&nbsp; Every exertion was used to wall in the
dangerous parts as quickly as possible; the excavators and
bricklayers labouring night and day until the work was
finished.&nbsp; Even while under the protection of the immense
pumping power above described, it often happened that the bricks
were scarcely covered with cement ready for the setting, ere they
were washed quite clean by the streams of water which poured from
overhead.&nbsp; The men were accordingly under the necessity of
holding over their work large whisks of straw and other
appliances to protect the bricks and cement at the moment of
setting.</p>
<p>The quantity of water pumped out of the sand bed during eight
months of incessant pumping, averaged 2,000 gallons per minute,
raised from an average depth of 120 feet.&nbsp; It is difficult
to form an adequate idea of the bulk of the water thus raised,
but it may be stated that if allowed to flow for three hours
only, it would fill a lake one acre square to the depth of one
foot, and if allowed to flow for one entire day it would fill the
lake to over eight feet in depth, or sufficient to float vessels
of 100 tons burthen.&nbsp; The water pumped out of the tunnel
while the work was in progress would be nearly equivalent to the
contents of the Thames at high water, between London and
Woolwich.&nbsp; It is a curious circumstance that notwithstanding
the quantity <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>thus removed, the level of the
surface of the water in the tunnel was only lowered about
2&frac12; to 3 inches per week, proving the vast area of the
quicksand, which probably extended along the entire ridge of land
under which the railway passed.</p>
<p>The cost of the line was greatly increased by the difficulties
encountered at Kilsby.&nbsp; The original estimate for the tunnel
was only &pound;99,000; but before it was finished it had cost
more than &pound;100 per lineal yard forward, or a total of
nearly &pound;300,000.&nbsp; The expenditure on the other parts
of the line also greatly exceeded the amount first set down by
the engineer; and before the works were finished it was more than
doubled.&nbsp; The land cost three times more than the estimate;
and the claims for compensation were enormous.&nbsp; Although the
contracts were let within the estimates, very few of the
contractors were able to complete them without the assistance of
the Company, and many became bankrupt.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the works, which were unprecedented in
England, was one of the most remarkable features in the
undertaking.&nbsp; The following striking comparison has been
made between this railway and one of the greatest works of
ancient times.&nbsp; The Great Pyramid of Egypt was, according to
Diodorus Siculus, constructed by 300,000&mdash;according to
Herodotus, by 100,000&mdash;men.&nbsp; It required for its
execution twenty years, and the labour expended upon it has been
estimated as equivalent to lifting 15,733,000,000 of cubic feet
of stone one foot high.&nbsp; Whereas, if the labour expended in
constructing the London and Birmingham Railway be in like manner
reduced to one common denomination the result is 25,000,000,000
of cubic feet <i>more</i> than was lifted for the Great Pyramid;
and yet the English work was performed by about 20,000 men in
less than five years.&nbsp; And whilst the Egyptian work was
executed by a powerful monarch concentrating upon it the labour
and capital of a great nation, the English railway was
constructed, in the face of every conceivable obstruction and
difficulty, by a <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>company of private individuals out
of their own resources, without the aid of Government or the
contribution of one farthing of public money.</p>
<p>The labourers who executed this formidable work were in many
respects a remarkable class.&nbsp; The &ldquo;railway
navvies,&rdquo; as they are called, were men drawn by the
attraction of good wages from all parts of the kingdom; and they
were ready for any sort of hard work.&nbsp; Some of the best came
from the fen districts of Lincoln and Cambridge, where they had
been trained to execute works of excavation and embankment.&nbsp;
These old practitioners formed a nucleus of skilled manipulation
and aptitude, which rendered them of indispensable utility in the
immense undertakings of the period.&nbsp; Their expertness in all
sorts of earthwork, in embanking, boring, and
well-sinking&mdash;their practical knowledge of the nature of
soils and rocks, the tenacity of clays, and the porosity of
certain stratifications&mdash;were very great; and, rough-looking
though they were, many of them were as important in their own
department as the contractor or the engineer.</p>
<p>During the railway-making period the navvy wandered about from
one public work to another&mdash;apparently belonging to no
country and having no home.&nbsp; He usually wore a white felt
hat with the brim turned up, a velveteen or jean square-tailed
coat, a scarlet plush waistcoat with little black spots, and a
bright-coloured kerchief round his herculean neck, when, as often
happened, it was not left entirely bare.&nbsp; His corduroy
breeches were retained in position by a leathern strap round the
waist, and were tied and buttoned at the knee, displaying beneath
a solid calf and foot encased in strong high-laced boots.&nbsp;
Joining together in a &ldquo;butty gang,&rdquo; some ten or
twelve of these men would take a contract to cut out and remove
so much &ldquo;dirt&rdquo;&mdash;as they denominated
earth-cutting&mdash;fixing their price according to the character
of the &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; and the distance to which it had to
be wheeled and tipped.&nbsp; The contract taken, every man put
himself on his mettle; if any <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>was found
skulking, or not putting forth his full working power, he was
ejected from the gang.&nbsp; Their powers of endurance were
extraordinary.&nbsp; In times of emergency they would work for 12
and even 16 hours, with only short intervals for meals.&nbsp; The
quantity of flesh-meat which they consumed was something
enormous; but it was to their bones and muscles what coke is to
the locomotive&mdash;the means of keeping up the steam.&nbsp;
They displayed great pluck, and seemed to disregard peril.&nbsp;
Indeed the most dangerous sort of labour&mdash;such as working
horse-barrow runs, in which accidents are of constant
occurrence&mdash;has always been most in request amongst them,
the danger seeming to be one of its chief recommendations.</p>
<p>Working, eating, drinking, and sleeping together, and daily
exposed to the same influences, these railway labourers soon
presented a distinct and well-defined character, strongly marking
them from the population of the districts in which they
laboured.&nbsp; Reckless alike of their lives as of their
earnings, the navvies worked hard and lived hard.&nbsp; For their
lodging, a hut of turf would content them; and, in their hours of
leisure, the meanest public-house would serve for their
parlour.&nbsp; Unburdened, as they usually were, by domestic
ties, unsoftened by family affection, and without much moral or
religious training, the navvies came to be distinguished by a
sort of savage manners, which contrasted strangely with those of
the surrounding population.&nbsp; Yet, ignorant and violent
though they might be, they were usually good-hearted fellows in
the main&mdash;frank and openhanded with their comrades, and
ready to share their last penny with those in distress.&nbsp;
Their pay-nights were often a saturnalia of riot and disorder,
dreaded by the inhabitants of the villages along the line of
works.&nbsp; The irruption of such men into the quiet hamlet of
Kilsby must, indeed, have produced a very startling effect on the
recluse inhabitants of the place.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson used to
tell a story of the clergyman of the parish waiting upon the
foreman of one of the gangs to expostulate with him as to the
shocking <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>impropriety of his men working
during Sunday.&nbsp; But the head navvy merely hitched up his
trousers, and said, &ldquo;Why, Soondays hain&rsquo;t cropt out
here yet!&rdquo;&nbsp; In short, the navvies were little better
than heathens, and the village of Kilsby was not restored to its
wonted quiet until the tunnel-works were finished, and the
engines and scaffoldings removed, leaving only the immense masses
of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> around the line of shafts which extend
along the top of the tunnel.</p>
<p>In illustration of the extraordinary working energy and powers
of endurance of the English navvies, we may mention that when
railway-making extended to France, the English contractors for
the works took with them gangs of English navvies, with the usual
plant, which included wheelbarrows.&nbsp; These the English navvy
was accustomed to run out rapidly and continuously, piled so high
with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that he could barely see over the summit
of his load, the gang-board along which he wheeled his
barrow.&nbsp; While he thus easily ran out some 3 or 4 cwt. at a
time, the French navvy was contented with half the weight.&nbsp;
Indeed, the French navvies on one occasion struck work because of
the size of the English barrows, and there was an
<i>&eacute;meute</i> on the Rouen Railway, which was only quelled
by the aid of the military.&nbsp; The consequence was that the
big barrows were abandoned to the English workmen, who earned
nearly double the wages of the Frenchmen.&nbsp; The manner in
which they stood to their work was matter of great surprise and
wonderment to the French countrypeople, who came crowding round
them in their blouses, and, after gazing admiringly at their
expert handling of the pick and mattock, and the immense loads of
&ldquo;dirt&rdquo; which they wheeled out, would exclaim to each
other, &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, <i>voila</i>! <i>voila ces
Anglais</i>, <i>comme ils travaillent</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rapidity with which railways were carried out, when the
spirit of the country became roused, was indeed remarkable.&nbsp;
This was doubtless in some measure owing to the increased force
of the current of speculation at the time, but chiefly to the
desire which the public began to entertain for the general
extension of the system.&nbsp; It was even proposed to fill up
the canals, and convert them into railways.&nbsp; The new roads
became the topic of conversation in all circles; they were felt
to give a new value to time; their vast capabilities for
&ldquo;business&rdquo; peculiarly recommended them to the trading
classes; whilst the friends of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; dilated on
the great benefits they would eventually confer upon mankind at
large.&nbsp; It began to be seen that Edward Pease had not been
exaggerating when he said, &ldquo;Let the country but make the
railroads, and the railroads will make the country!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They also came to be regarded as inviting objects of investment
to the thrifty, and a safe outlet for the accumulations of inert
men of capital.&nbsp; Thus new avenues of iron road were soon in
course of formation, branching in all directions, so that the
country promised in a wonderfully short time to become wrapped in
one vast network of iron.</p>
<p>In 1836 the Grand Junction Railway was under construction
between Warrington and Birmingham&mdash;the northern part by Mr.
Stephenson, and the southern by Mr. Rastrick.&nbsp; The works on
that line embraced heavy cuttings, long embankments, and numerous
viaducts; but none of these <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>are worthy
of any special description.&nbsp; Perhaps the finest piece of
masonry on the railway is the Dutton Viaduct across the valley of
the Weaver.&nbsp; It consists of twenty arches of 60 feet span,
springing 16 feet from the perpendicular shaft of each pier, and
60 feet in height from the crown of the arches to the level of
the river.&nbsp; The foundations of the piers were built on piles
driven 20 feet deep.&nbsp; The structure has a solid and majestic
appearance, and is perhaps the finest of George
Stephenson&rsquo;s viaducts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The Manchester and Leeds line was in progress at the same
time&mdash;an important railway connecting the principal
manufacturing towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire.&nbsp; An attempt
was made to obtain the Act as early as 1831; but its promoters
were defeated by the powerful opposition of the landowners aided
by the canal companies, and the project was not revived for
several years.&nbsp; The line was somewhat circuitous, and the
works were heavy; but on the whole the gradients were favourable,
and it had the <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>advantage of passing through a
district full of manufacturing towns and villages, teeming hives
of population, industry, and enterprise.&nbsp; The Act
authorising the construction of the railway was obtained in 1836;
it was greatly amended in the succeeding year, and the first
ground was broken on the 18th August, 1837.</p>
<p>In conducting this project to an issue, the engineer had the
usual opposition and prejudices to encounter.&nbsp; Predictions
were confidently made in many quarters that the line could never
succeed.&nbsp; It was declared that the utmost engineering skill
could not construct a railway through such a country of hills and
hard rocks; and it was maintained that, even if the railroad were
practicable, it could only be made at a ruinous cost.</p>
<p>During the progress of the works, as the Summit Tunnel, near
Littleborough, was approaching completion, the rumour was spread
abroad in Manchester that the tunnel had fallen in and buried a
number of the workmen.&nbsp; The last arch had been keyed in, and
the work was all but finished, when the accident occurred which
was thus exaggerated by the lying tongue of rumour.&nbsp; An
invert had given way through the irregular pressure of the
surrounding earth and rock at a part of the tunnel where a
&ldquo;fault&rdquo; had occurred in the strata.&nbsp; A party of
the directors accompanied the engineer to inspect the scene of
the accident.&nbsp; They entered the tunnel&rsquo;s mouth
preceded by upwards of fifty navvies, each bearing a torch.</p>
<p>After walking a distance of about half a mile, the inspecting
party arrived at the scene of the &ldquo;frightful
accident,&rdquo; about which so much alarm had been spread.&nbsp;
All that was visible was a certain unevenness of the ground,
which had been forced up by the invert under it giving way; thus
the ballast had been loosened, the drain running along the centre
of the road had been displaced, and small pools of water stood
about.&nbsp; But the whole of the walls and the roof were still
as perfect as at any other part of the tunnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>
<a href="images/p256.jpg">
<img alt=
"Entrance to the Summit Tunnel, Littleborough"
title=
"Entrance to the Summit Tunnel, Littleborough"
src="images/p256.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The engineer explained the cause of the accident; the blue
shale, he said, through which the excavation passed at that
point, was considered so hard and firm, as to render it
unnecessary to build the invert very strong there.&nbsp; But
shale is always a deceptive material.&nbsp; Subjected to the
influence of the atmosphere, it gives but a treacherous
support.&nbsp; In this case, falling away like quicklime, it had
left the lip of the invert alone to support the pressure of the
arch above, and hence its springing inwards and upwards.&nbsp;
Mr. Stephenson directed the attention of the visitors to the
completeness of the arch overhead, where not the slightest
fracture or yielding could be detected.&nbsp; Speaking of the
work, in the course of the same day, he said, &ldquo;I will stake
my character and my head, if that tunnel ever give way, so as to
cause danger to any of the public passing through it.&nbsp; <!--
page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>Taking it as a whole, I don&rsquo;t think there is such
another piece of work in the world.&nbsp; It is the greatest work
that has yet been done of this kind, and there has been less
repairing than is usual,&mdash;though an engineer might well be
beaten in his calculations, for he cannot beforehand see into
those little fractured parts of the earth he may meet
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Stephenson had promised, the invert was put
in; and the tunnel was made perfectly safe.</p>
<p>The construction of this subterranean road employed the labour
of above a thousand men for nearly four years.&nbsp; Besides
excavating the arch out of a solid rock, they used 23,000,000 of
bricks, and 8000 tons of Roman cement in the building of the
tunnel.&nbsp; Thirteen stationary engines, and about 100 horses,
were also employed in drawing the earth and stone out of the
shafts.&nbsp; Its entire length is 2869 yards, or nearly
1&frac34; mile&mdash;exceeding the famous Kilsby Tunnel by 471
yards.</p>
<p>The Midland Railway was a favourite line of Mr.
Stephenson&rsquo;s for several reasons.&nbsp; It passed through a
rich mining district, in which it opened up many valuable
coalfields, and it formed part of the great main line of
communication between London and Edinburgh.&nbsp; The Act was
obtained in 1836, and the first ground was broken in February,
1837.</p>
<p>Although the Midland Railway was only one of the many great
works of the same kind executed at that time, it was almost
enough of itself to be the achievement of a life.&nbsp; Compare
it, for example with Napoleon&rsquo;s military road over the
Simplon, and it will at once be seen how greatly it excels that
work, not only in the constructive skill displayed in it, but
also in its cost and magnitude, and the amount of labour employed
in its formation.&nbsp; The road of the Simplon is 45 miles in
length; the North Midland Railway is 72&frac12; miles.&nbsp; The
former has 50 bridges and 5 tunnels, measuring together 1338 feet
in length; the latter has 200 bridges and 7 tunnels, measuring
together 11,400 feet, or about 2&frac14; miles.&nbsp; The former
cost about &pound;720,000 <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>sterling,
the latter above &pound;3,000,000.&nbsp; Napoleon&rsquo;s grand
military road was constructed in six years, at the public cost of
the two great kingdoms of France and Italy; while
Stephenson&rsquo;s railway was formed in about three years, by a
company of private merchants and capitalists out of their own
funds, and under their own superintendence.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary that we should give any account in
detail of the North Midland works.&nbsp; The making of one tunnel
so much resembles the making of another,&mdash;the building of
bridges and viaducts, no matter how extensive, so much resembles
the building of others,&mdash;the cutting out of
&ldquo;dirt,&rdquo; the blasting of rocks, and the wheeling of
excavation into embankments, is so much a matter of mere time and
hard work,&mdash;that is quite unnecessary for us to detain the
reader by any attempt at their description.&nbsp; Of course there
were the usual difficulties to encounter and overcome,&mdash;but
the railway engineer regarded these as mere matters of course,
and would probably have been disappointed if they had not
presented themselves.</p>
<p>On the Midland, as on other lines, water was the great enemy
to be fought against,&mdash;water in the Claycross and other
tunnels,&mdash;water in the boggy or sandy foundations of
bridges,&mdash;and water in cuttings and embankments.&nbsp; As an
illustration of the difficulties of bridge building, we may
mention the case of the five-arch bridge over the Derwent, where
it took two years&rsquo; work, night and day, to get in the
foundations of the piers alone.&nbsp; Another curious
illustration of the mischief done by water in cuttings may be
briefly mentioned.&nbsp; At a part of the North Midland Line,
near Ambergate, it was necessary to pass along a hillside in a
cutting a few yards deep.&nbsp; As the cutting proceeded, a seam
of shale was cut across, lying at an inclination of 6 to 1; and
shortly after, the water getting behind the bed of shale, the
whole mass of earth along the hill above began to move down
across the line of excavation.&nbsp; The accident completely
upset the estimates of the contractor, who, instead of 50,000
cubic yards, found that he had about <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>500,000 to
remove; the execution of this part of the railway occupying
fifteen months instead of two.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Oakenshaw cutting near Wakefield was also of a very
formidable character.&nbsp; About 600,000 yards of rock shale and
bind were quarried out of it, and led to form the adjoining
Oakenshaw embankment.&nbsp; The Normanton cutting was almost as
heavy, requiring the removal of 400,000 yards of the same kind of
excavation into embankment and spoil.&nbsp; But the progress of
the works on the line was so rapid in 1839, that not less than
450,000 cubic yards of excavation were removed monthly.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As a curiosity in construction, we may also mention a very
delicate piece of work executed on the same railway at Bullbridge
in Derbyshire, where the line at the same point passes
<i>over</i> a bridge which here spans the river Amber, and
<i>under</i> the bed of the Cromford Canal.&nbsp; Water, bridge;
railway, and canal, were thus piled one above the other, four
stories high; such another curious complication probably not
existing.&nbsp; In order to prevent the possibility of the waters
of the canal breaking in upon the works of the railroad, Mr.
Stephenson had an iron trough made, 150 feet long, of the width
of the canal, and exactly fitting the bottom.&nbsp; It was
brought to the spot in three pieces, which were firmly welded
together, and the trough was then floated into its place and
sunk; the whole operation being completed without in the least
interfering with the navigation of the canal.&nbsp; The railway
works underneath were then proceeded with and finished.</p>
<p><!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>Another line of the same series constructed by George
Stephenson, was the York and North Midland, extending from
Normanton&mdash;a point on the Midland Railway&mdash;to York; but
it was a line of easy formation, traversing a comparatively level
country.</p>
<p>During the time that our engineer was engaged in
superintending the execution of these undertakings, he was
occupied upon other projected railways in various parts of the
country.&nbsp; He surveyed several lines in the neighbourhood of
Glasgow, and afterwards routes along the east coast from
Newcastle to Edinburgh, with the view of completing the main line
of communication with London.&nbsp; When out on foot in the
fields, on these occasions, he was ever foremost in the march;
and he delighted to test the prowess of his companions by a good
jump at any hedge or ditch that lay in their way.&nbsp; His
companions used to remark his singular quickness of
observation.&nbsp; Nothing escaped his attention&mdash;the trees,
the crops, the birds, or the farmer&rsquo;s stock; and he was
usually full of lively conversation, everything in nature
affording him an opportunity for making some striking remark, or
propounding some ingenious theory.&nbsp; When taking a flying
survey of a new line, his keen observation proved very useful to
him, for he rapidly noted the general configuration of the
country, and inferred its geological structure.&nbsp; He
afterwards remarked to a friend, &ldquo;I have planned many a
railway travelling along in a postchaise, and following the
natural line of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was remarkable
that his first impressions of the direction to be taken almost
invariably proved correct; and there are few of the lines
surveyed and recommended by him which have not been executed,
either during his lifetime or since.&nbsp; As an illustration of
his quick and shrewd observation on such occasions, we may
mention that when employed to lay out a line to connect
Manchester, through Macclesfield, with the Potteries, the
gentleman who accompanied him on the journey of inspection
cautioned him to provide large accommodation for carrying off the
water, <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>observing&mdash;&ldquo;You must not
judge by the appearance of the brooks; for after heavy rains
these hills pour down volumes of <i>water</i>, of which you can
have no conception.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pooh! pooh!
<i>don&rsquo;t I see your bridges</i>?&rdquo; replied the
engineer.&nbsp; He had noted the details of each as he passed
along.</p>
<p>Among the other projects which occupied his attention about
the same time, were the projected lines between Chester and
Holyhead, between Leeds and Bradford, and between Lancaster and
Maryport by the western coast.&nbsp; This latter was intended to
form part of a west-coast line to Scotland; Stephenson favouring
it partly because of the flatness of the gradients, and also
because it could be formed at comparatively small cost, whilst it
would open out a valuable iron-mining district, from which a
large traffic in ironstone was expected.&nbsp; One of its
collateral advantages, in the engineer&rsquo;s opinion, was, that
by forming the railway directly across Morecambe Bay, on the
north-west coast of Lancashire, a large tract of valuable land
might be reclaimed from the sea, the sale of which would
considerably reduce the cost of the works.&nbsp; He estimated
that by means of a solid embankment across the bay, not less than
40,000 acres of rich alluvial land would be gained.&nbsp; He
proposed to carry the road across the ten miles of sands which
lie between Poulton, near Lancaster, and Humphrey Head on the
opposite coast, forming the line in a segment of a circle of five
miles&rsquo; radius.&nbsp; His plan was to drive in piles across
the entire length, forming a solid fence of stone blocks on the
land side for the purpose of retaining the sand and silt brought
down by the rivers from the interior.&nbsp; The embankment would
then be raised from time to time as the deposit accumulated,
until the land was filled up to high-water mark; provision being
made by means of sufficient arches, for the flow of the river
waters into the bay.&nbsp; The execution of the railway after
this plan would, however, have occupied more years than the
promoters of the West Coast line were disposed to wait; and
eventually Mr. Locke&rsquo;s more direct but uneven line by Shap
Fell was <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>adopted.&nbsp; A railway has since
been carried across the head of the bay; and it is not improbable
that Stephenson&rsquo;s larger scheme of reclaiming the vast
tract of land now left bare at each receding tide, may yet be
carried out.</p>
<p>While occupied in carrying out the great railway undertakings
which we have above so briefly described, Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s
home continued, for the greater part of the time, to be at Alton
Grange, near Leicester.&nbsp; But he was so much occupied in
travelling about from one committee of directors to
another&mdash;one week in England, another in Scotland, and
probably the next in Ireland,&mdash;that he often did not see his
home for weeks together.&nbsp; He had also to make frequent
inspections of the various important and difficult works in
progress, especially on the Midland and Manchester and Leeds
lines; besides occasionally going to Newcastle to see how the
locomotive works were going on there.&nbsp; During the three
years ending in 1837&mdash;perhaps the busiest years of his life
<a name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a>&mdash;he travelled by postchaise alone
upwards of 20,000 miles, and yet not less than six months out of
the three years were spent in London.&nbsp; Hence there is
comparatively little to record of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s private
life at this period; during which he had scarcely a moment that
he could call his own.</p>
<p>His correspondence increased so much, that he found it
necessary to engage a private secretary, who accompanied him on
his journeys.&nbsp; He was himself exceedingly averse to writing
letters.&nbsp; The comparatively advanced age at which ho learnt
the art of writing, and the nature of his duties while engaged at
the Killingworth colliery, precluded that facility in
correspondence which only constant practice can <!-- page
264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>give.&nbsp; He gradually, however, acquired great
facility in dictation, and possessed the power of labouring
continuously at this work; the gentleman who acted as his
secretary in 1835, having informed us that during his busy season
he one day dictated not fewer than 37 letters, several of them
embodying the results of much close thinking and
calculation.&nbsp; On another occasion, he dictated reports and
letters for twelve continuous hours, until his secretary was
ready to drop off his chair from sheer exhaustion, and at length
he pleaded for a suspension of the labour.&nbsp; This great mass
of correspondence, although closely bearing on the subjects under
discussion, was not, however, of a kind to supply the biographer
with matter for quotation, or give that insight into the life and
character of the writer which the letters of literary men so
often furnish.&nbsp; They were, for the most part, letters of
mere business, relating to works in progress, parliamentary
contests, new surveys, estimates of cost, and railway
policy,&mdash;curt, and to the point; in short, the letters of a
man every moment of whose time was precious.&nbsp; He was also
frequently called upon to inspect and report upon colliery works,
salt works, brass and copper works, and such like, in addition to
his own colliery and railway business.&nbsp; And occasionally he
would run up to London, for the purpose of attending in person to
the preparation and deposit of the plans and sections of the
projected undertakings of which he had been appointed
engineer.</p>
<p>Fortunately Stephenson possessed a facility of sleeping, which
enabled him to pass through this enormous amount of fatigue and
labour without injury to his health.&nbsp; He had been trained in
a hard school, and could bear with ease conditions which, to men
more softly nurtured, would have been the extreme of physical
discomfort.&nbsp; Many, many nights he snatched his sleep while
travelling in his chaise; and at break of day he would be at
work, surveying until dark, and this for weeks in
succession.&nbsp; His whole powers seemed to be under the control
of his will, for he could wake at any hour, and go to work at
once.&nbsp; <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>It was difficult for secretaries and
assistants to keep up with such a man.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to record that in the midst of these engrossing
occupations, his heart remained as soft and loving as ever.&nbsp;
In spring-time he would not be debarred of his boyish pursuit of
bird-nesting; but would go rambling along the hedges spying for
nests.&nbsp; In the autumn he went nutting, and when he could
snatch a few minutes he indulged in his old love of
gardening.&nbsp; His uniform kindness and good temper, and his
communicative, intelligent disposition, made him a great
favourite with the neighbouring farmers, to whom he would
volunteer much valuable advice on agricultural operations,
drainage, ploughing, and labour-saving processes.&nbsp; Sometimes
he took a long rural ride on his favourite &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo;
now growing old, but as fond of his master as ever.&nbsp; Towards
the end of his life, &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; lived in clover, its
master&rsquo;s pet, doing no work; and he died at Tapton, in
1845, more than twenty years old.</p>
<p>During one of George&rsquo;s brief sojourns at the Grange, he
found time to write to his son a touching account of a pair of
robins that had built their nest within one of the upper chambers
of the house.&nbsp; One day he observed a robin fluttering
outside the windows, and beating its wings against the panes, as
if eager to gain admission.&nbsp; He went up stairs, and there
found, in a retired part of one of the rooms, a robin&rsquo;s
nest, with one of the parent birds sitting over three or four
young&mdash;all dead.&nbsp; The excluded bird outside still beat
against the panes; and on the window being let down, it flew into
the room, but was so exhausted that it dropped upon the
floor.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson took up the bird, carried it down
stairs, had it warmed and fed.&nbsp; The poor robin revived, and
for a time was one of his pets.&nbsp; But it shortly died too, as
if unable to recover from the privations it had endured during
its three days&rsquo; fluttering and beating at the
windows.&nbsp; It appeared that the room had been unoccupied,
and, the sash having been let down, the robins had taken the
opportunity of building their nest <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>within it;
but the servant having closed the window again, the calamity
befel the birds which so strongly excited Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s
sympathies.&nbsp; An incident such as this, trifling though it
may seem, gives the true key to the heart of the man.</p>
<p>The amount of their Parliamentary business having greatly
increased with the projection of new lines of railway, the
Stephensons found it necessary to set up an office in London in
1836.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s first office was at 9, Duke Street,
Westminster, from whence he removed in the following year to
30&frac12;, Great George-street.&nbsp; That office was the busy
scene of railway politics for several years.&nbsp; There
consultations were held, schemes were matured, deputations were
received, and many projectors called upon our engineer for the
purpose of submitting to him their plans of railways and railway
working.&nbsp; His private secretary at the time has informed us
that at the end of the first Parliamentary session in which he
had been engaged as engineer for more companies than one, it
became necessary for him to give instructions as to the
preparation of the accounts to be rendered to the respective
companies.&nbsp; In the simplicity of his heart, he directed Mr.
Binns to take his full time at the rate of ten guineas a day, and
charge the railway companies in the proportion in which he had
been actually employed on their respective business during each
day.&nbsp; When Robert heard of this instruction, he went
directly to his father and expostulated with him against this
unprofessional course; and, other influences being brought to
bear upon him, George at length reluctantly consented to charge
as other engineers did, an entire day&rsquo;s fee to each of the
Companies for which he was concerned whilst their business was
going forward; but he cut down the number of days charged for and
reduced the daily amount from ten to seven guineas.</p>
<p>Besides his journeys at home, Mr. Stephenson was on more than
one occasion called abroad on railway business.&nbsp; Thus, at
the desire of King Leopold, he made several visits to Belgium to
assist the Belgian engineers in laying out the <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>national
lines of that kingdom.&nbsp; That enlightened monarch at an early
period discerned the powerful instrumentality of railways in
developing a country&rsquo;s resources, and he determined at the
earliest possible period to adopt them as the great high-roads of
the nation.&nbsp; The country, being rich in coal and minerals,
had great manufacturing capabilities.&nbsp; It had good ports,
fine navigable rivers, abundant canals, and a teeming,
industrious population.&nbsp; Leopold perceived that railways
were eminently calculated to bring the industry of the country
into full play, and to render the riches of the provinces
available to the rest of the kingdom.&nbsp; He therefore openly
declared himself the promoter of public railways throughout
Belgium.&nbsp; A system of lines was projected, at his instance,
connecting Brussels with the chief towns and cities of the
kingdom; extending from Ostend eastward to the Prussian frontier,
and from Antwerp southward to the French frontier.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson and his son, as the leading railway-engineers
of England, were consulted by the King on the best mode of
carrying out his important plans, as early as 1835.&nbsp; In the
course of that year they visited Belgium, and had several
interesting conferences with Leopold and his ministers on the
subject of the proposed railways.&nbsp; The King then appointed
George Stephenson by royal ordinance a Knight of the Order of
Leopold.&nbsp; At the invitation of the monarch, Mr. Stephenson
made a second visit to Belgium in 1837, on the occasion of the
public opening of the line from Brussels to Ghent.&nbsp; At
Brussels there was a public procession, and another at Ghent on
the arrival of the train.&nbsp; Stephenson and his party
accompanied it to the Public Hall, there to dine with the chief
Ministers of State, the municipal authorities, and about five
hundred of the principal inhabitants of the city; the English
Ambassador being also present.&nbsp; After the King&rsquo;s
health and a few others had been drunk, that of Mr. Stephenson
was proposed; on which the whole assembly rose up, amidst great
excitement and loud applause, and made their way to <!-- page
268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>where he sat, in order to jingle glasses with him,
greatly to his own amazement.&nbsp; On the day following, our
engineer dined with the King and Queen at their own table at
Laaken, by special invitation; afterwards accompanying his
Majesty and suite to a public ball given by the municipality of
Brussels, in honour of the opening of the line to Ghent, as well
as of their distinguished English guest.&nbsp; On entering the
room, the general and excited inquiry was, &ldquo;Which is
Stephenson?&rdquo;&nbsp; The English engineer had not before
imagined that he was esteemed to be so great a man.</p>
<p>The London and Birmingham Railway having been completed in
September, 1838, after being about five years in progress, the
great main system of railway communication between London,
Liverpool, and Manchester was then opened to the public.&nbsp;
For some months previously, the line had been partially opened,
coaches performing the journey between Denbigh Hall (near
Wolverton) and Rugby,&mdash;the works of the Kilsby tunnel being
still incomplete.&nbsp; It was already amusing to hear the
complaints of the travellers about the slowness of the coaches as
compared with the railway, though the coaches travelled at the
speed of eleven miles an hour.&nbsp; The comparison of comfort
was also greatly to the disparagement of the coaches.&nbsp; Then
the railway train could accommodate any quantity, whilst the road
conveyances were limited; and when a press of travellers
occurred&mdash;as on the occasion of the Queen&rsquo;s
coronation&mdash;the greatest inconvenience was experienced, and
as much as &pound;10 was paid for a seat on a donkey-chaise
between Rugby and Denbigh.&nbsp; On the opening of the railway
throughout, of course all this inconvenience and delay was
brought to an end.</p>
<p>Numerous other openings of railways constructed by Mr.
Stephenson took place about the same time.&nbsp; The Birmingham
and Derby line was opened for traffic in August, 1839; the
Sheffield and Rotherham in November, 1839; and in the course of
the following year, the Midland, the York and <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>North
Midland, the Chester and Crewe, the Chester and Birkenhead, the
Manchester and Birmingham, the Manchester and Leeds, and the
Maryport and Carlisle railways, were all publicly opened in whole
or in part.&nbsp; Thus 321 miles of railway (exclusive of the
London and Birmingham) constructed under Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s
superintendence, at a cost of upwards of eleven millions
sterling, were, in the course of about two years, added to the
traffic accommodation of the country.</p>
<p>The ceremonies which accompanied the public opening of these
lines were often of an interesting character.&nbsp; The adjoining
population held general holiday; bands played, banners waved, and
assembled thousands cheered the passing trains amidst the
occasional booming of cannon.&nbsp; The proceedings were usually
wound up by a public dinner; and in the course of the speeches
which followed, Mr. Stephenson would revert to his favourite
topic&mdash;the difficulties which he had early encountered in
the promotion of the railway system, and in establishing the
superiority of the locomotive.&nbsp; On such occasions he always
took great pleasure in alluding to the services rendered to
himself and the public by the young men brought up under his
eye&mdash;his pupils at first, and afterwards his
assistants.&nbsp; No great master ever possessed a more devoted
band of assistants and fellow-workers than he did.&nbsp; It was
one of the most marked evidences of his own admirable tact and
judgment that he selected, with such undeviating correctness, the
men best fitted to carry out his plans.&nbsp; Indeed, the ability
to accomplish great things, and to carry grand ideas into
practical effect, depends in no small measure on that intuitive
knowledge of character, which Stephenson possessed in so
remarkable a degree.</p>
<p>At the dinner at York, which followed the partial opening of
the York and North Midland Railway, Mr. Stephenson said,
&ldquo;he was sure they would appreciate his feelings when he
told them, that when he first began railway business his hair was
black, although it was now grey; and <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>that he
began his life&rsquo;s labour as but a poor ploughboy.&nbsp;
About thirty years since, he had applied himself to the study of
how to generate high velocities by mechanical means.&nbsp; He
thought he had solved that problem; and they had for themselves
seen, that day, what perseverance had brought him too.&nbsp; He
was, on that occasion, only too happy to have an opportunity of
acknowledging that he had, in the latter portion of his career,
received much most valuable assistance, particularly from young
men brought up in his manufactory.&nbsp; Whenever talent showed
itself in a young man he had always given that talent
encouragement where he could, and he would continue to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this was no exaggerated statement is amply proved by many
facts which redound to Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s credit.&nbsp; He
was no niggard of encouragement and praise when he saw honest
industry struggling for a footing.&nbsp; Many were the young men
whom, in the course of his useful career, he took by the hand and
led steadily up to honour and emolument, simply because he had
noted their zeal, diligence, and integrity.&nbsp; One youth
excited his interest while working as a common carpenter on the
Liverpool and Manchester line; and before many years had passed,
he was recognised as an engineer of distinction.&nbsp; Another
young man he found industriously working away at his bye-hours,
and, admiring his diligence, engaged him for his private
secretary, the gentleman shortly after rising to a position of
eminent influence and usefulness.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing gave Mr.
Stephenson greater pleasure than in this way to help on any
deserving youth who came under his observation, and, in his own
expressive phrase, to &ldquo;make a man of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The openings of the great main lines of railroad communication
shortly proved the fallaciousness of the numerous rash prophecies
which had been promulgated by the opponents of railways.&nbsp;
The proprietors of the canals were astounded by the fact that,
notwithstanding the immense traffic conveyed by rail, their own
traffic and receipts <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>continued to increase; and that, in
common with other interests, they fully shared in the expansion
of trade and commerce which had been so effectually promoted by
the extension of the railway system.&nbsp; The cattle-owners were
equally amazed to find the price of horse-flesh increasing with
the extension of railways, and that the number of coaches running
to and from the new railway stations gave employment to a greater
number of horses than under the old stage-coach system.&nbsp;
Those who had prophesied the decay of the metropolis, and the
ruin of the suburban cabbage-growers, in consequence of the
approach of railways to London, were also disappointed; for,
while the new roads let citizens out of London, they let
country-people in.&nbsp; Their action, in this respect, was
centripetal as well as centrifugal.&nbsp; Tens of thousands who
had never seen the metropolis could now visit it expeditiously
and cheaply; and Londoners who had never visited the country, or
but rarely, were enabled, at little cost of time or money, to see
green fields and clear blue skies, far from the smoke and bustle
of town.&nbsp; If the dear suburban-grown cabbages became
depreciated in value, there were truck-loads of fresh-grown
country cabbages to make amends for the loss: in this case, the
&ldquo;partial evil&rdquo; was a far more general good.&nbsp; The
food of the metropolis became rapidly improved, especially in the
supply of wholesome meat and vegetables.&nbsp; And then the price
of coals&mdash;an article which, in this country, is as
indispensable as daily food to all classes&mdash;was greatly
reduced.&nbsp; What a blessing to the metropolitan poor is
described in this single fact!</p>
<p>The prophecies of ruin and disaster to landlords and farmers
were equally confounded by the openings of the railways.&nbsp;
The agricultural communications, so far from being
&ldquo;destroyed,&rdquo; as had been predicted, were immensely
improved.&nbsp; The farmers were enabled to buy their coals,
lime, and manure for less money, while they obtained a readier
access to the best markets for their stock and
farm-produce.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>predictions
to the contrary, their cows gave milk as before, their sheep fed
and fattened, and even skittish horses ceased to shy at the
passing locomotive.&nbsp; The smoke of the engines did not
obscure the sky, nor were farmyards burnt up by the fire thrown
from the locomotives.&nbsp; The farming classes were not reduced
to beggary; on the contrary, they soon felt that, so far from
having anything to dread, they had very much good to expect from
the extension of railways.</p>
<p>Landlords also found that they could get higher rents for
farms situated near a railway than at a distance from one.&nbsp;
Hence they became clamorous for &ldquo;sidings.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
felt it to be a grievance to be placed at a distance from a
station.&nbsp; After a railway had been once opened, not a
landlord would consent to have the line taken from him.&nbsp;
Owners who had fought the promoters before Parliament, and
compelled them to pass their domains at a distance, at a
vastly-increased expense in tunnels and deviations, now
petitioned for branches and nearer station accommodation.&nbsp;
Those who held property near towns, and had extorted large sums
as compensation for the anticipated deterioration in the value of
their building land, found a new demand for it springing up at
greatly advanced prices.&nbsp; Land was now advertised for sale,
with the attraction of being &ldquo;near a railway
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prediction that, even if railways were made, the public
would not use them, was also completely falsified by the
results.&nbsp; The ordinary mode of fast travelling for the
middle classes had heretofore been by mail-coach and
stage-coach.&nbsp; Those who could not afford to pay the high
prices charged for such conveyances went by waggon, and the
poorer classes trudged on foot.&nbsp; George Stephenson was wont
to say that he hoped to see the day when it would be cheaper for
a poor man to travel by railway than to walk, and not many years
passed before his expectation was fulfilled.&nbsp; In no country
in the world is time worth more money than in England; and by
saving time&mdash;the criterion <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>of
distance&mdash;the railway proved a great benefactor to men of
industry in all classes.</p>
<p>It was some time before the more opulent, who could afford to
post to town in aristocratic style, became reconciled to railway
travelling.&nbsp; In the opinion of many, it was only another
illustration of the levelling tendencies of the age.&nbsp; It put
an end to that gradation of rank in travelling which was one of
the few things left by which the nobleman could be distinguished
from the Manchester manufacturer and bagman.&nbsp; But to younger
sons of noble families the convenience and cheapness of the
railway did not fail to recommend itself.&nbsp; One of these,
whose eldest brother had just succeeded to an earldom, said one
day to a railway manager: &ldquo;I like railways&mdash;they just
suit young fellows like me with &lsquo;nothing per annum paid
quarterly.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know we can&rsquo;t afford to post,
and it used to be deuced annoying to me, as I was jogging along
on the box-seat of the stage-coach, to see the little Earl go by
drawn by his four posters, and just look up at me and give me a
nod.&nbsp; But now, with railways, it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s true, he may take a first-class ticket, while I can
only afford a second-class one, but <i>we both go the same
pace</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time, however, many of the old families sent forward
their servants and luggage by railroad, and condemned themselves
to jog along the old highway in the accustomed family chariot,
dragged by country post-horses.&nbsp; But the superior comfort of
the railway shortly recommended itself to even the oldest
families; posting went out of date; post-horses were with
difficulty to be had along even the great high-roads; and nobles
and servants, manufacturers and peasants, alike shared in the
comfort, the convenience, and the despatch of railway
travelling.&nbsp; The late Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, regarded the
opening of the London and Birmingham line as another great step
accomplished in the march of civilisation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rejoice
to see it,&rdquo; he said, as he stood on one of the bridges over
the railway, and watched the train flashing along under him, and
away through the <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span

<p>It was long before the late Duke of Wellington would trust
himself behind a locomotive.&nbsp; The fatal accident to Mr.
Huskisson, which had happened before his eyes, contributed to
prejudice him strongly against railways, and it was not until the
year 1843 that he performed his first trip on the South-Western
Railway, in attendance upon her Majesty.&nbsp; Prince Albert had
for some time been accustomed to travel by railway alone, but in
1842 the Queen began to make use of the same mode of conveyance
between Windsor and London.&nbsp; Even Colonel Sibthorpe was
eventually compelled to acknowledge its utility.&nbsp; For a time
he continued to post to and from the country as before.&nbsp;
Then he compromised the matter by taking a railway ticket for the
long journey, and posting only a stage or two nearest town;
until, at length, he undisguisedly committed himself, like other
people, to the express train, and performed the journey
throughout upon what he had formerly denounced as &ldquo;the
infernal railroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While George Stephenson was engaged in carrying on the works
of the Midland Railway in the neighbourhood of Chesterfield,
several seams of coal were cut through in the Claycross Tunnel,
and it occurred to him that if mines were opened out there, the
railway would provide the means of a ready sale for the article
in the midland counties, and as far south as even the metropolis
itself.</p>
<p>At a time when everybody else was sceptical as to the <!--
page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>possibility of coals being carried from the midland
counties to London, and sold there at a price to compete with
those which were seaborne, he declared his firm conviction that
the time was fast approaching when the London market would be
regularly supplied with north-country coals led by railway.&nbsp;
One of the greatest advantages of railways, in his opinion was
that they would bring iron and coal, the staple products of the
country, to the doors of all England.&nbsp; &ldquo;The strength
of Britain,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;lies in her iron and coal
beds; and the locomotive is destined, above all other agencies,
to bring it forth.&nbsp; The Lord Chancellor now sits upon a bag
of wool; but wool has long ceased to be emblematical of the
staple commodity of England.&nbsp; He ought rather to sit upon a
bag of coals, though it might not prove quite so comfortable a
seat.&nbsp; Then think of the Lord Chancellor being addressed as
the noble and learned lord <i>on the coal-sack</i>!&nbsp; I am
afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t answer, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To one gentleman he said: &ldquo;We want from the coal-mining,
the iron-producing and manufacturing districts, a great railway
for the carriage of these valuable products.&nbsp; We want, if I
may so say, a stream of steam running directly through the
country, from the North to London, and from other similar
districts to London.&nbsp; Speed is not so much an object as
utility and cheapness.&nbsp; It will not do to mix up the heavy
merchandise and coal trains with the passenger trains.&nbsp; Coal
and most kinds of goods can wait; but passengers will not.&nbsp;
A less perfect road and less expensive works will do well enough
for coal trains, if run at a low speed; and if the line be flat,
it is not of much consequence whether it be direct or not.&nbsp;
Whenever you put passenger trains on a line, all the other trains
must be run at high speeds to keep out of their way.&nbsp; But
coal trains run at high speeds pull the road to pieces, besides
causing large expenditure in locomotive power; and I doubt very
much whether they will pay after all; but a succession of long
coal trains, if run at from ten to fourteen miles an hour, would
pay very well.&nbsp; Thus the Stockton <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>and
Darlington Company made a larger profit when running coal at low
speeds at a halfpenny a ton per mile, than they have been able to
do since they put on their fast passenger trains, when everything
must needs be run faster, and a much larger proportion of the
gross receipts is absorbed by working expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In advocating these views, Mr. Stephenson was considerably
ahead of his time; and although he did not live to see his
anticipations fully realised as to the supply of the London
coal-market, he was nevertheless the first to point out, and to
some extent to prove, the practicability of establishing a
profitable coal trade by railway between the northern counties
and the metropolis.&nbsp; So long, however, as the traffic was
conducted on main passenger lines at comparatively high speeds,
it was found that the expenditure on tear and wear of road and
locomotive power,&mdash;not to mention the increased risk of
carrying on the first-class passenger traffic with which it was
mixed up,&mdash;necessarily left a very small margin of profit;
and hence Mr. Stephenson was in the habit of urging the propriety
of constructing a railway which should be exclusively devoted to
goods and mineral traffic run at low speeds as the only condition
on which a large railway traffic of that sort could be profitably
conducted.</p>
<p>Having induced some of his Liverpool friends to join him in a
coal-mining adventure at Chesterfield, a lease was taken of the
Claycross estate, then for sale, and operations were shortly
after begun.&nbsp; At a subsequent period Mr. Stephenson extended
his coal-mining operations in the same neighbourhood; and in 1841
he himself entered into a contract with owners of land in
adjoining townships for the working of the coal thereunder; and
pits were opened on the Tapton estate on an extensive
scale.&nbsp; About the same time he erected great lime-works,
close to the Ambergate station of the Midland Railway, from
which, when in full operation he was able to turn out upwards of
200 tons a day.&nbsp; The limestone was brought on a tramway from
the village of <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>Crich, 2 or 3 miles distant, the
coal being supplied from his adjoining Claycross colliery.&nbsp;
The works were on a scale such as had not before been attempted
by any private individual engaged in a similar trade; and we
believe they proved very successful.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Tapton House was included in the lease of one of the
collieries, and as it was conveniently situated&mdash;being, as
it were, a central point on the Midland Railway, from which he
could readily proceed north or south, on his journeys of
inspection of the various lines then under construction in the
midland and northern counties,&mdash;he took up his residence
there, and it continued his home until the close of his life.</p>
<p>Tapton House is a large roomy brick mansion, beautifully
situated amidst woods, upon a commanding eminence, about a mile
to the north-east of the town of Chesterfield.&nbsp; Green fields
dotted with fine trees slope away from the <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>house in
all directions.&nbsp; The surrounding country is undulating and
highly picturesque.&nbsp; North and south the eye ranges over a
vast extent of lovely scenery; and on the west, looking over the
town of Chesterfield, with its church and crooked spire, the
extensive range of the Derbyshire hills bounds the
distance.&nbsp; The Midland Railway skirts the western edge of
the park in a deep rock cutting, and the shrill whistle of the
locomotive sounds near at hand as the trains speed past.&nbsp;
The gardens and pleasure-grounds adjoining the house were in a
very neglected state when Mr. Stephenson first went to Tapton;
and he promised himself, when he had secured rest and leisure
from business, that he would put a new face upon both.&nbsp; The
first improvement he made was cutting a woodland footpath up the
hill-side, by which he at the same time added a beautiful feature
to the park, and secured a shorter road to the Chesterfield
station.&nbsp; But it was some years before he found time to
carry into effect his contemplated improvements in the adjoining
gardens and pleasure-grounds.&nbsp; He had so long been
accustomed to laborious pursuits, and felt himself still so full
of work, that he could not at once settle down into the habit of
quietly enjoying the fruits of his industry.</p>
<p>He had no difficulty in usefully employing his time.&nbsp;
Besides directing the mining operations at Claycross, the
establishment of the lime-kilns at Ambergate, and the
construction of the extensive railways still in progress, he
occasionally paid visits to Newcastle, where his locomotive
manufactory was now in full work, and the proprietors were
reaping the advantages of his early foresight in an abundant
measure of prosperity.&nbsp; One of his most interesting visits
to the place was in 1838, on the occasion of the meeting of the
British Association there, when he acted as one of the
Vice-Presidents in the section of Mechanical Science.&nbsp;
Extraordinary changes had occurred in his own fortunes, as well
as in the face of the country, since he had first appeared before
a scientific body in Newcastle&mdash;the <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>members of
the Literary and Philosophical Institute&mdash;to submit his
safety-lamp for their examination.&nbsp; Twenty-three years had
passed over his head, full of honest work, of manful struggle;
and the humble &ldquo;colliery engine-wright of the name of
Stephenson&rdquo; had achieved an almost worldwide reputation as
a public benefactor.&nbsp; His fellow-townsmen, therefore, could
not hesitate to recognise his merits and do honour to his
name.&nbsp; During the sittings of the Association, Mr.
Stephenson took the opportunity of paying a visit to
Killingworth, accompanied by some of the distinguished
<i>savans</i> whom he numbered amongst his friends.&nbsp; He
there pointed out to them, with a degree of honest pride, the
cottage in which he had lived for so many years, showed what
parts of it had been his own handiwork, and told them the story
of the sun-dial over the door, describing the study and the
labour it had cost him and his son to calculate its dimensions,
and fix it in its place.&nbsp; The dial had been serenely
numbering the hours through the busy years that had elapsed since
that humble dwelling had been his home; during which the
Killingworth locomotive had become a great working power, and its
contriver had established the railway system, which was now
rapidly becoming extended in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>About the same time, his services were very much in request at
the meetings of Mechanics&rsquo; Institutes held throughout the
northern counties.&nbsp; From an early period in his history, he
had taken an active interest in these institutions.&nbsp; While
residing at Newcastle in 1824, shortly after his locomotive
foundry had been started in Forth-street, he presided at a public
meeting held in that town for the purpose of establishing a
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute.&nbsp; The meeting was held; but as
George Stephenson was a man comparatively unknown even in
Newcastle at that time, his name failed to secure &ldquo;an
influential attendance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among those who addressed
the meeting on the occasion was Joseph Locke, then his pupil, and
afterwards his rival as an engineer.&nbsp; The local papers
scarcely noticed the <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>proceedings; yet the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute was founded, and struggled into
existence.&nbsp; Years passed, and it was now felt to be an
honour to secure Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s presence at any public
meetings held for the promotion of popular education.&nbsp; Among
the Mechanics&rsquo; Institutes in his immediate neighbourhood at
Tapton, were those of Belper and Chesterfield; and at their
soir&eacute;es he was a frequent and a welcome visitor.&nbsp; On
these occasions he loved to tell his auditors of the difficulties
which had early beset him through want of knowledge, and of the
means by which he had overcome them.&nbsp; His grand text
was&mdash;<span class="smcap">Persevere</span>; and there was
manhood in the very word.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, the author had the pleasure of
listening to George Stephenson&rsquo;s homely but forcible
addresses at the annual soir&eacute;es of the Leeds
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute.&nbsp; He was always an immense
favourite with his audiences there.&nbsp; His personal appearance
was greatly in his favour.&nbsp; A handsome, ruddy, expressive
face, lit up by bright dark-blue eyes, prepared one for his
earnest words when he stood up to speak and the cheers had
subsided which invariably hailed his rising.&nbsp; He was not
glib, but he was very impressive.&nbsp; And who, so well as he,
could serve as a guide to the working man in his endeavours after
higher knowledge?&nbsp; His early life had been all
struggle&mdash;encounter with difficulty&mdash;groping in the
dark after greater light, but always earnestly and
perseveringly.&nbsp; His words were therefore all the more
weighty, since he spoke from the fulness of his own
experience.</p>
<p>Nor did he remain a mere inactive spectator of the
improvements in railway working which increasing experience from
day to day suggested.&nbsp; He continued to contrive improvements
in the locomotive, and to mature his invention of the
carriage-brake.&nbsp; When examined before the Select Committee
on Railways in 1841, his mind seems principally to have been
impressed with the necessity which existed for adopting a system
of self acting brakes; stating that, in his opinion, this was the
most important arrangement that <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>could be
provided for increasing the safety of railway travelling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if self-acting
brakes were put upon every carriage, scarcely any accident could
take place.&rdquo;&nbsp; His plan consisted in employing the
momentum of the running train to throw his proposed brakes into
action, immediately on the moving power of the engine being
checked.&nbsp; He would also have these brakes under the control
of the guard, by means of a connecting line running along the
whole length of the train, by which they should at once be thrown
out of gear when necessary.&nbsp; At the same time he suggested,
as an additional means of safety, that the signals of the line
should be self-acting, and worked by the locomotives as they
passed along the railway.&nbsp; He considered the adoption of
this plan of so much importance, that, with a view to the public
safety, he would even have it enforced upon railway companies by
the legislature.&nbsp; At the same time he was of opinion that it
was the interest of the companies themselves to adopt the plan,
as it would save great tear and wear of engines, carriages,
tenders, and brake-vans, besides greatly diminishing the risk of
accidents upon railways.</p>
<p>While before the same Committee, he took the opportunity of
stating his views with reference to railway speed, about which
wild ideas were then afloat&mdash;one gentleman of celebrity
having publicly expressed the opinion that a speed of 100 miles
an hour was practicable in railway travelling!&nbsp; Not many
years had passed since George Stephenson had been pronounced
insane for stating his conviction that 12 miles an hour could be
performed by the locomotive; but now that he had established the
fact, and greatly exceeded that speed, he was thought behind the
age because he recommended the rate to be limited to 40 miles an
hour.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I do not like either 40 or 50 miles
an hour upon any line&mdash;I think it is an unnecessary speed;
and if there is danger upon a railway, it is high velocity that
creates it.&nbsp; I should say no railway ought to exceed 40
miles an hour on the most favourable gradient; but upon a curved
line <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>the speed ought not to exceed 24 or
25 miles an hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, indeed, constructed for
the Great Western Railway an engine capable of running 50 miles
an hour with a load, and 80 miles without one.&nbsp; But he never
was in favour of a hurricane speed of this sort, believing it
could only be accomplished at an unnecessary increase both of
danger and expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he observed on other occasions,
&ldquo;I have said the locomotive engine <i>might</i> be made to
travel 100 miles an hour; but I always put a qualification on
this, namely, as to what speed would best suit the public.&nbsp;
The public may, however, be unreasonable; and 50 or 60 miles an
hour is an unreasonable speed.&nbsp; Long before railway
travelling became general, I said to my friends that there was no
limit to the speed of the locomotive, <i>provided the works could
be made to stand</i>.&nbsp; But there are limits to the strength
of iron, whether it be manufactured into rails or locomotives;
and there is a point at which both rails and tyres must
break.&nbsp; Every increase of speed, by increasing the strain
upon the road and the rolling stock, brings us nearer to that
point.&nbsp; At 30 miles a slighter road will do, and less
perfect rolling stock may be run upon it with safety.&nbsp; But
if you increase the speed by say 10 miles, then everything must
be greatly strengthened.&nbsp; You must have heavier engines,
heavier and better-fastened rails, and all your working expenses
will be immediately increased.&nbsp; I think I know enough of
mechanics to know where to stop.&nbsp; I know that a pound will
weigh a pound, and that no more should be put upon an iron rail
than it will bear.&nbsp; If you could ensure perfect iron,
perfect rails, and perfect locomotives, I grant 50 miles an hour
or more might be run with safety on a level railway.&nbsp; But
then you must not forget that iron, even the best, will
&lsquo;tire,&rsquo; and with constant use will become more and
more liable to break at the weakest point&mdash;perhaps where
there is a secret flaw that the eye cannot detect.&nbsp; Then
look at the rubbishy rails now manufactured on the contract
system&mdash;some of them <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>little
better than cast metal: indeed, I have seen rails break merely on
being thrown from the truck on to the ground.&nbsp; How is it
possible for such rails to stand a 20 or 30 ton engine dashing
over them at the speed of 50 miles an hour?&nbsp; No, no,&rdquo;
he would conclude, &ldquo;I am in favour of low speeds because
they are safe, and because they are economical; and you may rely
upon it that, beyond a certain point, with every increase of
speed there is an increase in the element of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When railways became the subject of popular discussion, many
new and unsound theories were started with reference to them,
which Stephenson opposed as calculated, in his opinion, to bring
discredit on the locomotive system.&nbsp; One of these was with
reference to what were called &ldquo;undulating
lines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among others, Dr. Lardner, who had originally
been somewhat sceptical about the powers of the locomotive, now
promulgated the idea that a railway constructed with rising and
falling gradients would be practically as easy to work as a line
perfectly level.&nbsp; Mr. Badnell went even beyond him, for he
held that an undulating railway was much better than a level one
for purposes of working.&nbsp; For a time, this theory found
favour, and the &ldquo;undulating system&rdquo; was extensively
adopted; but Mr. Stephenson never ceased to inveigh against it;
and experience has amply proved that his judgment was
correct.&nbsp; His practice, from the beginning of his career
until the end of it, was to secure a road as nearly as possible
on a level, following the course of the valleys and the natural
line of the country: preferring to go round a hill rather than to
tunnel under it or carry his railway over it, and often making a
considerable circuit to secure good, workable gradients.&nbsp; He
studied to lay out his lines so that long trains of minerals and
merchandise, as well as passengers, might be hauled along them at
the least possible expenditure of locomotive power.&nbsp; He had
long before ascertained, by careful experiments at Killingworth,
that the engine expends half of its power in overcoming a rising
gradient of 1 in 260, which is about <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>20 feet in
the mile; and that when the gradient is so steep as 1 in 100, not
less than three-fourths of its power is sacrificed in ascending
the acclivity.&nbsp; He never forgot the valuable practical
lesson taught him by the early trials which he had made and
registered long before the advantages of railways had been
recognised.&nbsp; He saw clearly that the longer flat line must
eventually prove superior to the shorter line of steep gradients
as respected its paying qualities.&nbsp; He urged that, after
all, the power of the locomotive was but limited; and, although
he and his son had done more than any other men to increase its
working capacity, it provoked him to find that every improvement
made in it was neutralised by the steep gradients which the new
school of engineers were setting it to overcome.&nbsp; On one
occasion, when Robert Stephenson stated before a Parliamentary
Committee that every successive improvement in the locomotive was
being rendered virtually nugatory by the difficult and almost
impracticable gradients proposed on many of the new lines, his
father, on his leaving the witness-box, went up to him, and said,
&ldquo;Robert, you never spoke truer words than those in all your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this it must be added, that in urging these views Mr.
Stephenson was strongly influenced by commercial
considerations.&nbsp; He had no desire to build up his reputation
at the expense of railway shareholders, nor to obtain engineering
<i>&eacute;clat</i> by making &ldquo;ducks and drakes&rdquo; of
their money.&nbsp; He was persuaded that, in order to secure the
practical success of railways, they must be so laid out as not
only to prove of decided public utility, but also to be worked
economically and to the advantage of their proprietors.&nbsp;
They were not government roads, but private ventures&mdash;in
fact, commercial speculations.&nbsp; He therefore endeavoured to
render them financially profitable; and he repeatedly declared
that if he did not believe they could be &ldquo;made to
pay,&rdquo; he would have nothing to do with them.&nbsp; He was
not influenced by the sordid consideration of what he could
<i>make</i> out of any company that employed him; indeed, in <!--
page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>many cases he voluntarily gave up his claim to
remuneration where the promoters of schemes which he thought
praiseworthy had suffered serious loss.&nbsp; Thus, when the
first application was made to Parliament for the Chester and
Birkenhead Railway Bill, the promoters were defeated.&nbsp; They
repeated their application, on the understanding that in event of
their succeeding, the engineer and surveyor were to be paid their
costs in respect of the defeated measure.&nbsp; The Bill was
successful, and to several parties their costs were paid.&nbsp;
Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s amounted to &pound;800, and he very nobly
said, &ldquo;You have had an expensive career in Parliament; you
have had a great struggle; you are a young Company; you cannot
afford to pay me this amount of money.&nbsp; I will reduce it to
&pound;200, and I will not ask you for that &pound;200 until your
shares are at &pound;20 premium: for whatever may be the reverses
you will go through, I am satisfied I shall live to see the day
when your shares will be at &pound;20 premium, and when I can
legally and honourably claim that &pound;200.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may
add that the shares did eventually rise to the premium specified,
and the engineer was no loser by his generous conduct in the
transaction.</p>
<p>Another novelty of the time, with which George Stephenson had
to contend, was the substitution of atmospheric pressure for
locomotive steam-power in the working of railways.&nbsp; The idea
of obtaining motion by means of atmospheric pressure is said to
have originated with Denis Papin, more than 150 years ago; but it
slept until revived in 1810 by Mr. Medhurst, who published a
pamphlet to prove the practicability of carrying letters and
goods by air.&nbsp; In 1824, Mr. Vallance of Brighton took out a
patent for projecting passengers through a tube large enough to
contain a train of carriages; the tube being previously exhausted
of its atmospheric air.&nbsp; The same idea was afterwards taken
up, in 1835, by Mr. Pinkus, an ingenious American.&nbsp;
Scientific gentlemen, Dr. Lardner and Mr. Clegg amongst others,
advocated the plan; and an association was formed to carry it
into effect.&nbsp; Shares were <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>created,
and &pound;18,000 raised: and a model apparatus was exhibited in
London.&nbsp; Mr. Vignolles took his friend Stephenson to see the
model; and after carefully examining it, he observed
emphatically, &ldquo;<i>It won&rsquo;t do</i>: it is only the
fixed engines and ropes over again, in another form; and, to tell
you the truth, I don&rsquo;t think this rope of wind will answer
so well as the rope of wire did.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not think
the principle would stand the test of practice, and he objected
to the mode of applying the principle.&nbsp; After all, it was
only a modification of the stationary-engine plan; and every
day&rsquo;s experience was proving that fixed engines could not
compete with locomotives in point of efficiency and
economy.&nbsp; He stood by the locomotive engine; and subsequent
experience proved that he was right.</p>
<p>Messrs. Clegg and Samuda afterwards, in 1840, patented their
plan of an atmospheric railway; and they publicly tested its
working on an unfinished portion of the West London
Railway.&nbsp; The results of the experiment were so
satisfactory, that the directors of the Dublin and Kingstown line
adopted it between Kingstown and Dalkey.&nbsp; The London and
Croydon Company also adopted the atmospheric principle; and their
line was opened in 1845.&nbsp; The ordinary mode of applying the
power was to lay between the line of rails a pipe, in which a
large piston was inserted, and attached by a shaft to the
framework of a carriage.&nbsp; The propelling power was the
ordinary pressure of the atmosphere acting against the piston in
the tube on one side, a vacuum being created in the tube on the
other side of the piston by the working of a stationary
engine.&nbsp; Great was the popularity of the atmospheric system;
and still George Stephenson said &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do:
it&rsquo;s but a gimcrack.&rdquo;&nbsp; Engineers of distinction
said he was prejudiced, and that he looked upon the locomotive as
a pet child of his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a little,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;and you will see that I am right.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was generally supposed that the locomotive system was about to be
snuffed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; said
Stephenson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us wait to see if it will
pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>believed it
would.&nbsp; It was ingenious, clever, scientific, and all that;
but railways were commercial enterprises, not toys; and if the
atmospheric railway could not work to a profit, it would not
do.&nbsp; Considered in this light, he even went so far as to
call it &ldquo;a great humbug.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing will
beat the locomotive,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for efficiency in all
weathers, for economy in drawing loads of average weight, and for
power and speed as occasion may require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atmospheric system was fairly and fully tried, and it was
found wanting.&nbsp; It was admitted to be an exceedingly elegant
mode of applying power; its devices were very skilful, and its
mechanism was most ingenious.&nbsp; But it was costly, irregular
in action, and, in particular kinds of weather, not to be
depended upon.&nbsp; At best, it was but a modification of the
stationary-engine system, and experience proved it to be so
expensive that it was shortly after entirely abandoned in favour
of locomotive power. <a name="citation288"></a><a
href="#footnote288" class="citation">[288]</a></p>
<p>One of the remarkable results of the system of railway
locomotion which George Stephenson had by his persevering labours
mainly contributed to establish, was the outbreak of the railway
mania towards the close of his professional career.&nbsp; The
success of the first main lines of railway naturally led to their
extension into many new districts; but a strongly speculative
tendency soon began to display itself, which contained in it the
elements of great danger.</p>
<p>The extension of railways had, up to the year 1844, been
mainly effected by men of the commercial classes, and the
shareholders in them principally belonged to the manufacturing
districts,&mdash;the capitalists of the metropolis as yet <!--
page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>holding aloof, and prophesying disaster to all
concerned in railway projects.&nbsp; But when the lugubrious
anticipations of the City men were found to be so entirely
falsified by the results&mdash;when, after the lapse of years, it
was ascertained that railway traffic rapidly increased and
dividends steadily improved&mdash;a change came over the spirit
of the London capitalists.&nbsp; They then invested largely in
railways, the shares in which became a leading branch of business
on the Stock Exchange, and the prices of some rose to nearly
double their original value.</p>
<p>A stimulus was thus given to the projection of further lines,
the shares in most of which came out at a premium, and became the
subject of immediate traffic.&nbsp; A reckless spirit of gambling
set in, which completely changed the character and objects of
railway enterprise.&nbsp; The public outside the Stock Exchange
became also infected, and many persons utterly ignorant of
railways, knowing and caring nothing about their national uses,
but hungering and thirsting after premiums, rushed eagerly into
the vortex.&nbsp; They applied for allotments, and subscribed for
shares in lines, of the engineering character or probable traffic
of which they knew nothing.&nbsp; Provided they could but obtain
allotments which they could sell at a premium, and put the
profit&mdash;in many cases the only capital they possessed <a
name="citation289"></a><a href="#footnote289"
class="citation">[289]</a>&mdash;into their pocket, it was enough
for them.&nbsp; The mania was not confined to the precincts of
the Stock Exchange, but infected all ranks.&nbsp; It embraced
merchants and manufacturers, gentry and shopkeepers, clerks in
public offices, and loungers at the clubs.&nbsp; Noble lords were
pointed at as &ldquo;stags;&rdquo; there were even clergymen who
were characterised as &ldquo;bulls;&rdquo; and amiable ladies who
had the reputation of <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>&ldquo;bears,&rdquo; in the share
markets.&nbsp; The few quiet men who remained uninfluenced by the
speculation of the time were, in not a few cases, even reproached
for doing injustice to their families, in declining to help
themselves from the stores of wealth that were poured out on all
sides.</p>
<p>Folly and knavery were, for a time, completely in the
ascendant.&nbsp; The sharpers of society were let loose, and
jobbers and schemers became more and more plentiful.&nbsp; They
threw out railway schemes as lures to catch the unwary.&nbsp;
They fed the mania with a constant succession of new
projects.&nbsp; The railway papers became loaded with their
advertisements.&nbsp; The post-office was scarcely able to
distribute the multitude of prospectuses and circulars which they
issued.&nbsp; For a time their popularity was immense.&nbsp; They
rose like froth into the upper heights of society, and the
flunkey FitzPlushe, by virtue of his supposed wealth, sat amongst
peers and was idolised.&nbsp; Then was the harvest-time of
scheming lawyers, parliamentary agents, engineers, surveyors, and
traffic-takers, who were ready to take up any railway scheme
however desperate, and to prove any amount of traffic even where
none existed.&nbsp; The traffic in the credulity of their dupes
was, however, the great fact that mainly concerned them, and of
the profitable character of which there could be no doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson was anxiously entreated to lend his name to
prospectuses during the railway mania; but he invariably
refused.&nbsp; He held aloof from the headlong folly of the hour,
and endeavoured to check it, but in vain.&nbsp; Had he been less
scrupulous, and given his countenance to the numerous projects
about which he was consulted, he might, without any trouble, have
thus secured enormous gains; but he had no desire to accumulate a
fortune without labour and without honour.&nbsp; He himself never
speculated in shares.&nbsp; When he was satisfied as to the
merits of any undertaking, he subscribed for a certain amount of
capital in it, and held on, neither buying nor selling.&nbsp; At
a dinner of the Leeds and Bradford directors at Ben Rydding in
October, 1844, <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>before the mania had reached its
height, he warned those present against the prevalent disposition
towards railway speculation.&nbsp; It was, he said, like walking
upon a piece of ice with shallows and deeps; the shallows were
frozen over, and they would carry, but it required great caution
to get over the deeps.&nbsp; He was satisfied that in the course
of the next year many would step on to places not strong enough
to carry them, and would get into the deeps; they would be taking
shares, and afterwards be unable to pay the calls upon
them.&nbsp; Yorkshiremen were reckoned clever men, and his advice
to them was, to stick together and promote communication in their
own neighbourhood,&mdash;not to go abroad with their
speculations.&nbsp; If any had done so, he advised them to get
their money back as fast as they could, for if they did not they
would not get it at all.&nbsp; He informed the company, at the
same time, of his earliest holding of railway shares; it was in
the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and the number he held was
<i>three</i>&mdash;&ldquo;a very large capital for him to possess
at the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a Stockton friend was anxious to
possess a share, and he sold him <i>one</i> at a premium of 33s.;
he supposed he had been about the first man in England to sell a
railway share at a premium.</p>
<p>During 1845, his son&rsquo;s offices in Great George-street,
Westminster, were crowded with persons of various conditions
seeking interviews, presenting very much the appearance of the
levee of a minister of state.&nbsp; The burly figure of Mr.
Hudson, the &ldquo;Railway King,&rdquo; surrounded by an admiring
group of followers, was often to be seen there; and a still more
interesting person, in the estimation of many, was George
Stephenson, dressed in black, his coat of somewhat old-fashioned
cut, with square pockets in the tails.&nbsp; He wore a white
neckcloth, and a large bunch of seals was suspended from his
watch-ribbon.&nbsp; Altogether, he presented an appearance of
health, intelligence, and good humour, that rejoiced one to look
upon in that sordid, selfish and eventually ruinous saturnalia of
railway speculation.</p>
<p>Powers were granted by Parliament, in 1843, to construct <!--
page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>not less than 2883 miles of new railways in Britain, at
an expenditure of about forty-four millions sterling!&nbsp; Yet
the mania was not appeased; for in the following session of 1846,
applications were made to Parliament for powers to raise
&pound;389,000,000 sterling for the construction of further
lines; and powers were actually conceded for forming 4790 miles
(including 60 miles of tunnels), at a cost of about
&pound;120,000,000 sterling.&nbsp; During this session, Mr.
Stephenson appeared as engineer for only one new line,&mdash;the
Buxton, Macclesfield, Congleton, and Crewe Railway&mdash;a line
in which, as a coal-owner, he was personally
interested;&mdash;and of three branch-lines in connexion with
existing companies for which he had long acted as engineer.&nbsp;
At the same time, all the leading professional men were fully
occupied, some of them appearing as consulting engineers for
upwards of thirty lines each!</p>
<p>One of the features of the mania was the rage for
&ldquo;direct lines&rdquo; which everywhere displayed
itself.&nbsp; There were &ldquo;Direct Manchester,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Direct Exeter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Direct York,&rdquo; and,
indeed, new direct lines between most of the large towns.&nbsp;
The Marquis of Bristol, speaking in favour of the &ldquo;Direct
Norwich and London&rdquo; project, at a public meeting at
Haverhill, said, &ldquo;If necessary, they might <i>make a tunnel
beneath his very drawing-room</i>, rather than be defeated in
their undertaking!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Rev. F. Litchfield, at a
meeting in Banbury, on the subject of a line to that town, said
&ldquo;He had laid down for himself a limit to his approbation of
railways,&mdash;at least of such as approached the neighbourhood
with which he was connected,&mdash;and that limit was, that he
did not wish them to approach any nearer to him than <i>to run
through his bedroom</i>, <i>with the bedposts for a
station</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; How different was the spirit which
influenced these noble lords and gentlemen but a few years
before!</p>
<p>The House of Commons became thoroughly influenced by the
prevailing excitement.&nbsp; Even the Board of Trade began to
favour the views of the fast school of engineers.&nbsp; In their
&ldquo;Report on the Lines projected in the Manchester and <!--
page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>Leeds District,&rdquo; they promulgated some remarkable
views respecting gradients, declaring themselves in favour of the
&ldquo;undulating system.&rdquo;&nbsp; They there stated that
lines of an undulating character &ldquo;which have gradients of 1
in 70 or in 80 distributed over them in short lengths, may be
positively <i>better</i> lines, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>more susceptible
of cheap and expeditious working</i>, than others which have
nothing steeper than 1 in 100 or 1 in 120!&rdquo;&nbsp; They
concluded by reporting in favour of the line which exhibited the
worst gradients and the sharpest curves, chiefly on the ground
that it could be constructed for less money.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel took occasion to advert to this Report in the
House of Commons on the 4th of March following, as containing
&ldquo;a novel and highly important view on the subject of
gradients, which, he was certain, never could have been taken by
any Committee of the House of Commons, however
intelligent;&rdquo; and he might have added, that the more
intelligent, the less likely they were to arrive at any such
conclusion.&nbsp; When Mr. Stephenson saw this report of the
Premier&rsquo;s speech in the newspapers of the following
morning, he went forthwith to his son, and asked him to write a
letter to Sir Robert Peel on the subject.&nbsp; He saw clearly
that if these views were adopted, the utility and economy of
railways would be seriously curtailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;These members
of Parliament,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are now as much disposed to
exaggerate the powers of the locomotive, as they were to
under-estimate them but a few years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert
accordingly wrote a letter for his father&rsquo;s signature,
embodying the views which he so strongly entertained as to the
importance of flat gradients, and referring to the experiments
conducted by him many years before, in proof of the great loss of
working power which was incurred on a line of steep as compared
with easy gradients.&nbsp; It was clear, from the tone of Sir
Robert Peel&rsquo;s speech in a subsequent debate, that he had
carefully read and considered Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s practical
observations on the subject; though it did not appear that he had
come <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>to any definite conclusion thereon,
further than that he strongly approved of the Trent Valley
Railway, by which Tamworth would be placed upon a direct main
line of communication.</p>
<p>The result of the labours of Parliament was a tissue of
legislative bungling, involving enormous loss to the
public.&nbsp; Railway Bills were granted in heaps.&nbsp; Two
hundred and seventy-two additional Acts were passed in
1846.&nbsp; Some authorised the construction of lines running
almost parallel to existing railways, in order to afford the
public &ldquo;the benefits of unrestricted
competition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Locomotive and atmospheric lines,
broad-gauge and narrow-gauge lines, were granted without
hesitation.&nbsp; Committees decided without judgment and without
discrimination; it was a scramble for Bills, in which the most
unscrupulous were the most successful.</p>
<p>Amongst the many ill effects of the mania, one of the worst
was that it introduced a low tone of morality into railway
transactions.&nbsp; The bad spirit which had been evoked by it
unhappily extended to the commercial classes, and many of the
most flagrant swindles of recent times had their origin in the
year 1845.&nbsp; Those who had suddenly gained large sums without
labour, and also without honour, were too ready to enter upon
courses of the wildest extravagance; and a false style of living
shortly arose, the poisonous influence of which extended through
all classes.&nbsp; Men began to look upon railways as instruments
to job with.&nbsp; Persons, sometimes possessing information
respecting railways, but more frequently possessing none, got
upon boards for the purpose of promoting their individual
objects, often in a very unscrupulous manner; landowners, to
promote branch lines through their property; speculators in
shares, to trade upon the exclusive information which they
obtained; whilst some directors were appointed through the
influence mainly of solicitors, contractors, or engineers, who
used them as tools to serve their own ends.&nbsp; In this way the
unfortunate proprietors were, in many cases, betrayed, and their
<!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>property was shamefully squandered, much to the
discredit of the railway system.</p>
<p>While the mania was at its height in England, railways were
also being extended abroad, and George Stephenson was requested
on several occasions to give the benefit of his advice to the
directors of foreign undertakings.&nbsp; One of the most
agreeable of these excursions was to Belgium in 1845.&nbsp; His
special object was to examine the proposed line of the Sambre and
Meuse Railway, for which a concession had been granted by the
Belgian legislature.&nbsp; Arrived on the ground, he went
carefully over the entire length of the proposed line, to
Convins, the Forest of Ardennes, and Rocroi, across the French
frontier; examining the bearings of the coal-field, the slate and
marble quarries, and the numerous iron-mines in existence between
the Sambre and the Meuse, as well as carefully exploring the
ravines which extended through the district, in order to satisfy
himself that the best possible route had been selected.&nbsp; Mr.
Stephenson was delighted with the novelty of the journey, the
beauty of the scenery, and the industry of the population.&nbsp;
His companions were entertained by his ample and varied stores of
practical information on all subjects, and his conversation was
full of reminiscences of his youth, on which he always delighted
to dwell when in the society of his more intimate friends.&nbsp;
The journey was varied by a visit to the coal-mines near Jemappe,
where Stephenson examined with interest the mode adopted by the
Belgian miners of draining the pits, inspecting their engines and
brakeing machines, so familiar to him in early life.</p>
<p>The engineers of Belgium took the opportunity of Mr.
Stephenson&rsquo;s visit to their country to invite him to a
magnificent banquet at Brussels.&nbsp; The Public Hall, in which
they entertained him, was gaily decorated with flags, prominent
amongst which was the Union Jack, in honour of their
distinguished guest.&nbsp; A handsome marble pedestal, ornamented
with his bust crowned with laurels, occupied one end of the
room.&nbsp; The chair was occupied by M. Massui, <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>the Chief Director of the National Railways of Belgium;
and the most eminent scientific men of the kingdom were
present.&nbsp; Their reception of &ldquo;the Father of
railways&rdquo; was of the most enthusiastic description.&nbsp;
Mr. Stephenson was greatly pleased with the entertainment.&nbsp;
Not the least interesting incident of the evening was his
observing, when the dinner was about half over, a model of a
locomotive engine placed upon the centre table, under a triumphal
arch.&nbsp; Turning suddenly to his friend Sopwith, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Do you see the &lsquo;Rocket&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
compliment thus paid him, was perhaps more prized than all the
encomiums of the evening.</p>
<p>The next day (April 5th) King Leopold invited him to a private
interview at the palace.&nbsp; Accompanied by Mr. Sopwith, he
proceeded to Laaken, and was very cordially received by His
Majesty.&nbsp; The king immediately entered into familiar
conversation with him, discussing the railway project which had
been the object of his visit to Belgium, and then the structure
of the Belgian coal-fields,&mdash;his Majesty expressing his
sense of the great importance of economy in a fuel which had
become indispensable to the comfort and well-being of society,
which was the basis of all manufactures, and the vital power of
railway locomotion.&nbsp; The subject was always a favourite one
with Mr. Stephenson, and, encouraged by the king, he proceeded to
describe to him the geological structure of Belgium, the original
formation of coal, its subsequent elevation by volcanic forces,
and the vast amount of denudation.&nbsp; In describing the
coal-beds he used his hat as a sort of model to illustrate his
meaning; and the eyes of the king were fixed upon it as he
proceeded with his interesting description.&nbsp; The
conversation then passed to the rise and progress of trade and
manufactures,&mdash;Mr. Stephenson pointing out how closely they
everywhere followed the coal, being mainly dependent upon it, as
it were, for their very existence.</p>
<p>The king seemed greatly pleased with the interview, and at its
close expressed himself obliged by the <!-- page 297--><a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>interesting
information which the engineer had communicated.&nbsp; Shaking
hands cordially with both the gentlemen, and wishing them success
in their important undertakings, he bade them adieu.&nbsp; As
they were leaving the palace Mr. Stephenson, bethinking him of
the model by which he had just been illustrating the Belgian
coal-fields, said to his friend, &ldquo;By the bye, Sopwith, I
was afraid the king would see the inside of my hat; it&rsquo;s a
shocking bad one!&rdquo;&nbsp; Little could George Stephenson,
when brakesman at a coal-pit, have dreamt that, in the course of
his life, he should be admitted to an interview with a monarch,
and describe to him the manner in which the geological
foundations of his kingdom had been laid!</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson paid a second visit to Belgium in the course of
the same year, on the business of the West Flanders Railway; and
he had scarcely returned from it ere he made arrangements to
proceed to Spain, for the purpose of examining and reporting upon
a scheme then on foot for constructing &ldquo;the Royal North of
Spain Railway.&rdquo;&nbsp; A concession had been made by the
Spanish Government of a line of railway from Madrid to the Bay of
Biscay, and a numerous staff of engineers was engaged in
surveying it.&nbsp; The directors of the Company had declined
making the necessary deposits until more favourable terms had
been secured; and Sir Joshua Walmsley, on their part, was about
to visit Spain and press the Government on the subject.&nbsp; Mr.
Stephenson, whom he consulted, was alive to the difficulties of
the office which Sir Joshua was induced to undertake, and offered
to be his companion and adviser on the occasion,&mdash;declining
to receive any recompense beyond the simple expenses of the
journey.&nbsp; He could only arrange to be absent for six weeks,
and set out from England about the middle of September, 1845.</p>
<p>The party was joined at Paris by Mr. Mackenzie, the contractor
for the Orleans and Tours Railway, then in course of
construction, who took them over the works, and accompanied them
as far as Tours.&nbsp; They soon reached the <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>great chain
of the Pyrenees, and crossed over into Spain.&nbsp; It was on a
Sunday evening, after a long day&rsquo;s toilsome journey through
the mountains, that the party suddenly found themselves in one of
those beautiful secluded valleys lying amidst the Western
Pyrenees.&nbsp; A small hamlet lay before them, consisting of
some thirty or forty houses and a fine old church.&nbsp; The sun
was low on the horizon, and, under the wide porch, beneath the
shadow of the church, were seated nearly all the inhabitants of
the place.&nbsp; They were dressed in their holiday attire.&nbsp;
The bright bits of red and amber colour in the dresses of the
women, and the gay sashes of the men, formed a striking picture,
on which the travellers gazed in silent admiration.&nbsp; It was
something entirely novel and unexpected.&nbsp; Beside the
villagers sat two venerable old men, whose canonical hats
indicated their quality as village pastors.&nbsp; Two groups of
young women and children were dancing outside the porch to the
accompaniment of a simple pipe; and within a hundred yards of
them, some of the youths of the village were disporting
themselves in athletic exercises; the whole being carried on
beneath the fostering care of the old church, and with the
sanction of its ministers.&nbsp; It was a beautiful scene, and
deeply moved the travellers as they approached the principal
group.&nbsp; The villagers greeted them courteously, supplied
their present wants, and pressed upon them some fine melons,
brought from their adjoining gardens.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson used
afterwards to look back upon that simple scene, and speak of it
as one of the most charming pastorals he had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>They shortly reached the site of the proposed railway, passing
through Irun, St. Sebastian, St. Andero, and Bilbao, at which
places they met deputations of the principal inhabitants who were
interested in the subject of their journey.&nbsp; At Raynosa
Stephenson carefully examined the mountain passes and ravines
through which a railway could be made.&nbsp; He rose at break of
day, and surveyed until the darkness set in; and frequently his
resting-place <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>at night was the floor of some
miserable hovel.&nbsp; He was thus laboriously occupied for ten
days, after which he proceeded across the province of Old Castile
towards Madrid, surveying as he went.&nbsp; The proposed plan
included the purchase of the Castile Canal; and that property was
also surveyed.&nbsp; He next proceeded to El Escorial, situated
at the foot of the Guadarama mountains, through which he found
that it would be necessary to construct two formidable tunnels;
added to which he ascertained that the country between El
Escorial and Madrid was of a very difficult and expensive
character to work through.&nbsp; Taking these circumstances into
account, and looking at the expected traffic on the proposed
line, Sir Joshua Walmsley, acting under the advice of Mr.
Stephenson, offered to construct the line from Madrid to the Bay
of Biscay, only on condition that the requisite land was given
the Company for the purpose; that they should be allowed every
facility for cutting such timber belonging the Crown as might be
required for the purposes of the railway; and also that the
materials required from abroad for the construction of the line
should be admitted free of duty.&nbsp; In return for these
concessions the Company offered to clothe and feed several
thousands of convicts while engaged in the execution of the
earthworks.&nbsp; General Narvaez, afterwards Duke of Valencia,
received Sir Joshua Walmsley and Mr. Stephenson on the subject of
their proposition, and expressed his willingness to close with
them; but it was necessary that other influential parties should
give their concurrence before the scheme could be carried into
effect.&nbsp; The deputation waited ten days to receive the
answer of the Spanish Government; but no answer of any kind was
vouchsafed.&nbsp; The authorities, indeed, invited them to be
present at a Spanish bullfight, but that was not quite the
business Mr. Stephenson had gone all the way to Spain to
transact; and the offer was politely declined.&nbsp; The result
was, that Mr. Stephenson dissuaded his friend from making the
necessary deposit at Madrid.&nbsp; Besides, he had by this time
formed an <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>unfavourable opinion of the entire
project, and considered that the traffic would not amount to
one-eighth of the estimate.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson was now anxious to be in England.&nbsp; During
the journey from Madrid he often spoke with affection of friends
and relatives; and when apparently absorbed by other matters, he
would revert to what he thought might then be passing at
home.&nbsp; Few incidents worthy of notice occurred on the
journey homeward, but one may be mentioned.&nbsp; While
travelling in an open conveyance between Madrid and Vittoria, the
driver urged his mules down hill at a dangerous pace.&nbsp; He
was requested to slacken speed; but suspecting his passengers to
be afraid, he only flogged the brutes into a still more furious
gallop.&nbsp; Observing this, Mr. Stephenson coolly said,
&ldquo;Let us try him on the other tack; tell him to show us the
fastest pace at which Spanish mules can go.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
rogue of a driver, when he found his tricks of no avail, pulled
up and proceeded at a more moderate speed for the rest of the
journey.</p>
<p>Urgent business required Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s presence in
London on the last day of November.&nbsp; They travelled
therefore almost continuously, day and night; and the fatigue
consequent on the journey, added to the privations voluntarily
endured by the engineer while carrying on the survey among the
Spanish mountains, began to tell seriously on his health.&nbsp;
By the time he reached Paris he was evidently ill, but he
nevertheless determined on proceeding.&nbsp; He reached Havre in
time for the Southampton boat; but when on board, pleurisy
developed itself, and it was necessary to bleed him freely.&nbsp;
During the voyage, he spent his time chiefly in dictating letters
and reports to Sir Joshua Walmsley, who never left him, and whose
kindness on the occasion he gratefully remembered.&nbsp; His
friend was struck by the clearness of his dictated composition,
which exhibited a vigour and condensation which to him seemed
marvellous.&nbsp; After a few weeks&rsquo; rest at home, Mr.
Stephenson gradually recovered, though his health remained
severely shaken.</p>

<p>The career of George Stephenson was drawing to a close.&nbsp;
He had for some time been gradually retiring from the more active
pursuit of railway engineering, and confining himself to the
promotion of only a few undertakings in which he took a more than
ordinary personal interest.&nbsp; In 1840, when the extensive
main lines in the Midland districts had been finished and opened
for traffic, he publicly expressed his intention of withdrawing
from the profession.&nbsp; He had reached sixty, and, having
spent the greater part of his life in very hard work, he
naturally desired rest and retirement in his old age.&nbsp; There
was the less necessity for his continuing &ldquo;in
harness,&rdquo; as Robert <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Stephenson
was now in full career as a leading railway engineer, and his
father had pleasure in handing over to him, with the sanction of
the companies concerned, nearly all the railway appointments
which he held.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson amply repaid his father&rsquo;s care.&nbsp;
The sound education of which he had laid the foundations at
school, improved by his subsequent culture, but more than all by
his father&rsquo;s example of application, industry, and
thoroughness in all that he undertook, told powerfully in the
formation of his character, not less than in the discipline of
his intellect.&nbsp; His father had early implanted in him habits
of mental activity, familiarized him with the laws of mechanics,
and carefully trained and stimulated his inventive faculties, the
first great fruits of which, as we have seen, were exhibited in
the triumph of the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; at Rainhill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am fully conscious in my own mind,&rdquo; said the son
at a meeting of the Mechanical Engineers at Newcastle, in 1858,
&ldquo;how greatly my civil engineering has been regulated and
influenced by the mechanical knowledge which I derived directly
from my father; and the more my experience has advanced, the more
convinced I have become that it is necessary to educate an
engineer in the workshop.&nbsp; That is, emphatically, the
education which will render the engineer most intelligent, most
useful, and the fullest of resources in times of
difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson was but twenty-six years old when the
performances of the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; established the
practicability of steam locomotion on railways.&nbsp; He was
shortly after appointed engineer of the Leicester and Swannington
Railway; after which, at his father&rsquo;s request, he was made
joint engineer with himself in laying out the London and
Birmingham Railway, and the execution of that line was afterwards
entrusted to him as sole engineer.&nbsp; The stability and
excellence of the works of that railway, the difficulties which
had been successfully overcome in the course of its construction,
and the judgment which was displayed by Robert Stephenson
throughout the whole conduct <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>of the
undertaking to its completion, established his reputation as an
engineer; and his father could now look with confidence and with
pride upon his son&rsquo;s achievements.&nbsp; From that time
forward, father and son worked together as one man, each jealous
of the other&rsquo;s honour; and on the father&rsquo;s
retirement, it was generally recognized that, in the sphere of
railways, Robert Stephenson was the foremost man, the safest
guide, and the most active worker.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson was subsequently appointed engineer of the
Eastern Counties, the Northern and Eastern, and the Blackwall
railways, besides many lines in the midland and southern
districts.&nbsp; When the speculation of 1844 set in, his
services were, of course, greatly in request.&nbsp; Thus, in one
session, we find him engaged as engineer for not fewer than 33
new schemes.&nbsp; Projectors thought themselves fortunate who
could secure his name, and he had only to propose his terms to
obtain them.&nbsp; The work which he performed at this period of
his life was indeed enormous, and his income was large beyond any
previous instance of engineering gain.&nbsp; But much of his
labour was heavy hackwork of a very uninteresting
character.&nbsp; During the sittings of the committees of
Parliament, almost every moment of his time was occupied in
consultations, and in preparing evidence or in giving it.&nbsp;
The crowded, low-roofed committee-rooms of the old Houses of
Parliament were altogether inadequate to accommodate the rush of
perspiring projectors of bills, and even the lobbies were
sometimes choked with them.&nbsp; To have borne that noisome
atmosphere and heat would have tested the constitutions of
salamanders, and engineers were only human.&nbsp; With brains
kept in a state of excitement during the entire day, no wonder
their nervous systems became unstrung.&nbsp; Their only chance of
refreshment was during an occasional rush to the bun and sandwich
stand in the lobby, though sometimes even that resource failed
them.&nbsp; Then, with mind and body jaded&mdash;probably after
undergoing a series of consultations upon many bills after the
rising of the committees<!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>&mdash;the
exhausted engineers would seek to stimulate nature by a late,
perhaps a heavy, dinner.&nbsp; What chance had any ordinary
constitution of surviving such an ordeal?&nbsp; The consequence
was, that stomach, brain, and liver were alike irretrievably
injured; and hence the men who bore the brunt of those
struggles&mdash;Stephenson, Brunel, Locke, and
Errington&mdash;have already all died, comparatively young
men.</p>
<p>In mentioning the name of Brunel, we are reminded of him as
the principal rival and competitor of Robert Stephenson.&nbsp;
Both were the sons of distinguished men, and both inherited the
fame and followed in the footsteps of their fathers.&nbsp; The
Stephensons were inventive, practical, and sagacious; the Brunels
ingenious, imaginative, and daring.&nbsp; The former were as
thoroughly English in their characteristics as the latter were
perhaps as thoroughly French.&nbsp; The fathers and the sons were
alike successful in their works, though not in the same
degree.&nbsp; Measured by practical and profitable results, the
Stephensons were unquestionably the safer men to follow.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were destined
often to come into collision in the course of their professional
life.&nbsp; Their respective railway districts
&ldquo;marched&rdquo; with each other, and it became their
business to invade or defend those districts, according as the
policy of their respective boards might direct.&nbsp; The gauge
of 7 feet fixed by Mr. Brunel for the Great Western Railway, so
entirely different from that of 4ft. 8&frac12;in. adopted by the
Stephensons on the Northern and Midland lines, was from the first
a great cause of contention.&nbsp; But Mr. Brunel had always an
aversion to follow any man&rsquo;s lead; and that another
engineer had fixed the gauge of a railway, or built a bridge, or
designed an engine, in one way, was of itself often a sufficient
reason with him for adopting an altogether different
course.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson, on his part, though less bold,
was more practical, preferring to follow the old routes, and to
tread in the safe steps of his father.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunel, however, determined that the Great Western <!--
page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>should be a giant&rsquo;s road, and that travelling
should be conducted upon it at double speed.&nbsp; His ambition
was to make the <i>best</i> road that imagination could devise;
whereas the main object of the Stephensons, both father and son,
was to make a road that would <i>pay</i>.&nbsp; Although, tried
by the Stephenson test, Brunel&rsquo;s magnificent road was a
failure so far as the shareholders in the Great Western Company
were concerned, the stimulus which his ambitious designs gave to
mechanical invention at the time proved a general good.&nbsp; The
narrow-gauge engineers exerted themselves to quicken their
locomotives to the utmost.&nbsp; They improved and re-improved
them; the machinery was simplified and perfected; outside
cylinders gave place to inside; the steadier and more rapid and
effective action of the engine was secured; and in a few years
the highest speed on the narrow-gauge lines went up from 30 to
about 50 miles an hour.&nbsp; For this rapidity of progress we
are in no small degree indebted to the stimulus imparted to the
narrow-gauge engineers by Mr. Brunel.&nbsp; And it is well for a
country that it should possess men such as he, ready to dare the
untried, and to venture boldly into new paths.&nbsp; Individuals
may suffer from the cost of the experiments; but the nation,
which is an aggregate of individuals, gains, and so does the
world at large.</p>
<p>It was one of the characteristics of Brunel to believe in the
success of the schemes for which he was professionally engaged as
engineer; and he proved this by investing his savings largely in
the Great Western Railway, in the South Devon atmospheric line,
and in the Great Eastern steamship, with what results are well
known.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson, on the contrary, with
characteristic caution, towards the latter years of his life
avoided holding unguaranteed railway shares; and though he might
execute magnificent structures, such as the Victoria Bridge
across the St. Lawrence, he was careful not to embark any portion
of his own fortune in the ordinary capital of these
concerns.&nbsp; In 1845, he shrewdly foresaw the inevitable crash
that was <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>about to follow the mania of that
year; and while shares were still at a premium he took the
opportunity of selling out all that he had.&nbsp; He urged his
father to do the same thing, but George&rsquo;s reply was
characteristic.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I took my
shares for an investment, and not to speculate with, and I am not
going to sell them now because folks have gone mad about
railways.&rdquo;&nbsp; The consequence was, that he continued to
hold the &pound;60,000 which he had invested in the shares of
various railways until his death, when they were at once sold out
by his son, though at a great depreciation on their original
cost.</p>
<p>One of the hardest battles fought between the Stephensons and
Brunel was for the railway between Newcastle and Berwick, forming
part of the great East Coast route to Scotland.&nbsp; As early as
1836, George Stephenson had surveyed two lines to connect
Edinburgh with Newcastle: one by Berwick and Dunbar along the
coast, and the other, more inland, by Carter Fell, up the vale of
the Gala, to the northern capital; but both projects lay dormant
for several years longer, until the completion of the Midland and
other main lines as far north as Newcastle, had the effect of
again reviving the subject of the extension of the route as far
as Edinburgh.</p>
<p>On the 18th of June, 1844, the Newcastle and Darlington
line&mdash;an important link of the great main highway to the
north&mdash;was completed and publicly opened, thus connecting
the Thames and the Tyne by a continuous line of railway.&nbsp; On
that day the Stephensons, with a distinguished party of railway
men, travelled by express train from London to Newcastle in about
nine hours.&nbsp; It was a great event, and was worthily
celebrated.&nbsp; The population of Newcastle held holiday; and a
banquet given in the Assembly Rooms the same evening assumed the
form of an ovation to George Stephenson and his son.&nbsp; Thirty
years before, in the capacity of a workman, he had been labouring
at the construction of his first locomotive in the immediate
neighbourhood.&nbsp; By slow and laborious steps he had worked
his way <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>on, dragging the locomotive into
notice, and raising himself in public estimation; until at length
he had victoriously established the railway system, and went back
amongst his townsmen to receive their greeting.</p>
<p>After the opening of this railway, the project of the East
Coast line from Newcastle to Berwick was revived; and George
Stephenson, who had already identified himself with the question,
and was intimately acquainted with every foot of the ground, was
called upon to assist the promoters with his judgment and
experience.&nbsp; He again recommended as strongly as before the
line he had previously surveyed; and on its being adopted by the
local committee, the necessary steps were taken to have the
scheme brought before Parliament in the ensuing session.&nbsp;
The East Coast line was not, however, to be allowed to pass
without a fight.&nbsp; On the contrary, it had to encounter as
stout an opposition as the Stephensons had ever experienced.</p>
<p>We have already stated that about this time the plan of
substituting atmospheric pressure for locomotive steam-power in
the working of railways, had become very popular.&nbsp; Many
eminent engineers supported the atmospheric system, and a strong
party in Parliament, headed by the Prime Minister, were greatly
disposed in its favour.&nbsp; Mr. Brunel warmly espoused the
atmospheric principle, and his persuasive manner, as well as his
admitted scientific ability, unquestionably exercised
considerable influence in determining the views of many leading
members of both Houses.&nbsp; Amongst others, Lord Howick, one of
the members for Northumberland, adopted the new principle, and,
possessing great local influence, he succeeded in forming a
powerful confederacy of the landed gentry in favour of
Brunel&rsquo;s atmospheric railway through that county.</p>
<p>George Stephenson could not brook the idea of seeing the
locomotive, for which he had fought so many stout battles, pushed
to one side, and that in the very county in which its great
powers had been first developed.&nbsp; Nor did he relish the
appearance of Mr. Brunel as the engineer of Lord <!-- page
308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>Howick&rsquo;s scheme, in opposition to the line which
had occupied his thoughts and been the object of his strenuous
advocacy for so many years.&nbsp; When Stephenson first met
Brunel in Newcastle, he good-naturedly shook him by the collar,
and asked &ldquo;What business he had north of the
Tyne?&rdquo;&nbsp; George gave him to understand that they were
to have a fair stand-up fight for the ground, and, shaking hands
before the battle like Englishmen, they parted in good
humour.&nbsp; A public meeting was held at Newcastle in the
following December, when, after a full discussion of the merits
of the respective plans, Stephenson&rsquo;s line was almost
unanimously adopted as the best.</p>
<p>The rival projects went before Parliament in 1845, and a
severe contest ensued.&nbsp; The display of ability and tactics
on both sides was great.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson was examined at
great length as to the merits of the locomotive line, and Brunel
at equally great length as to the merits of the atmospheric
system.&nbsp; Mr. Brunel, in his evidence, said that after
numerous experiments, he had arrived at the conclusion that the
mechanical contrivance of the atmospheric system was perfectly
applicable, and he believed that it would likewise be more
economical in most cases than locomotive power.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
short,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;rapidity, comfort, safety, and
economy, are its chief recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the locomotive again triumphed.&nbsp; The Stephenson Coast
Line secured the approval of Parliament; and the shareholders in
the Atmospheric Company were happily prevented investing their
capital in what would unquestionably have proved a gigantic
blunder.&nbsp; For, less than three years later, the whole of the
atmospheric tubes which had been laid down on other lines were
pulled up and the materials sold&mdash;including Mr.
Brunel&rsquo;s immense tube on the South Devon Railway&mdash;to
make way for the working of the locomotive engine.&nbsp; George
Stephenson&rsquo;s first verdict of &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; was thus conclusively confirmed.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson used afterwards to describe with great gusto
an interview which took place between Lord <!-- page 309--><a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>Howick and
his father, at his office in Great George Street, during the
progress of the bill in Parliament.&nbsp; His father was in the
outer office, where he used to spend a good deal of his spare
time; occasionally taking a quiet wrestle with a friend when
nothing else was stirring. <a name="citation309"></a><a
href="#footnote309" class="citation">[309]</a>&nbsp; On the day
in question, George was standing with his back to the fire, when
Lord Howick called to see Robert.&nbsp; Oh! thought George, he
has come to try and talk Robert over about that atmospheric
gimcrack; but I&rsquo;ll tackle his Lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
in, my Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Robert&rsquo;s busy; but
I&rsquo;ll answer your purpose quite as well; sit down here, if
you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; George began, &ldquo;Now, my Lord, I
know very well what you have come about: it&rsquo;s that
atmospheric line in the north; I will show you in less than five
minutes that it can never answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If Mr.
Robert Stephenson is not at liberty, I can call again,&rdquo;
said his Lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly occupied on
important business just at present,&rdquo; was George&rsquo;s
answer; &ldquo;but I can tell you far better than he can what
nonsense the atmospheric system is: Robert&rsquo;s good-natured,
you see, and if your Lordship were to get alongside of him you
might talk him over; so you have been quite lucky in meeting with
me.&nbsp; Now, just look at the question of
expense,&rdquo;&mdash;and then he proceeded in his strong Doric
to explain his views in detail, until Lord Howick could stand it
no longer, and he rose and walked towards the door.&nbsp; George
followed him down stairs, to finish his demolition of the
atmospheric system, and his parting words were, &ldquo;You may
take my word for it, my Lord, it will never answer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
George afterwards told his son with glee of &ldquo;the
settler&rdquo; he had given Lord Howick.</p>
<p><!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>So closely were the Stephensons identified with this
measure, and so great was the personal interest which they were
both known to take in its success, that, on the news of the
triumph of the bill reaching Newcastle, a sort of general holiday
took place, and the workmen belonging to the Stephenson
Locomotive Factory, upwards of 800 in number, walked in
procession through the principal streets of the town, accompanied
with music and banners.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to enter into any description of the works
on the Newcastle and Berwick Railway.&nbsp; There are no fewer
than 110 bridges of all sorts on the line&mdash;some under and
some over it.&nbsp; But by far the most formidable piece of
masonry work on this railway is at its northern extremity, where
it passes across the Tweed into Scotland, immediately opposite
the formerly redoubtable castle of Berwick.&nbsp; Not many
centuries had passed since the district amidst which this bridge
stands was the scene of almost constant warfare.&nbsp; Berwick
was regarded as the key of Scotland, and was fiercely fought for,
sometimes held by a Scotch and sometimes by an English
garrison.&nbsp; Though strongly fortified, it was repeatedly
taken by assault.&nbsp; On its capture by Edward I., Boetius says
17,000 persons were slain, so that its streets &ldquo;ran with
blood like a river.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within sight of the ramparts, a
little to the west, is Halidon Hill, where a famous victory was
gained by Edward III., over the Scottish army under Douglas; and
there is scarcely a foot of ground in the neighbourhood but has
been the scene of contention in days long past.&nbsp; In the
reigns of James I. and Charles I., a bridge of 15 arches was
built across the Tweed at Berwick; and in our own day a
railway-bridge of 28 arches has been built a little above the old
one, but at a much higher level.&nbsp; The bridge built by the
Kings, out of the national resources, cost &pound;15,000, and
occupied 24 years and 4 months in the building; the bridge built
by the Railway Company, with funds drawn from private resources,
cost &pound;120,000, and was finished in 3 years and 4 months
from the day of laying the foundation-stone.</p>

<p><!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>This important viaduct, built after the design of
Robert Stephenson, consists of a series of 28 semicircular
arches, each 61 feet 6 inches in span, the greatest height above
the bed of the river being 126 feet.&nbsp; The whole is built of
ashlar, with a hearting of rubble; excepting the river parts of
the arches, which are constructed with bricks laid in
cement.&nbsp; The total length of the work is 2160 feet.&nbsp;
The foundations of the piers were got in by coffer-dams in the
ordinary way, Nasmyth&rsquo;s steam-hammer being extensively used
in driving the piles.&nbsp; The bearing piles, from which the
foundations of the piers were built up, were each capable of
carrying 70 tons.</p>
<p>Another bridge, of still greater importance, necessary to
complete the continuity of the East Coast route, was the
masterwork erected by Robert Stephenson between the north and
south banks of the Tyne at Newcastle, commonly known as the High
Level Bridge.&nbsp; Mr. R. W. Brandling, George
Stephenson&rsquo;s early friend, is entitled to the merit of
originating the idea of this bridge as it was eventually carried
out, with a central terminus for the northern railways in the
Castle Garth.&nbsp; The plan was first promulgated by him in
1841; and in the following year it was resolved that George
Stephenson should be consulted as to the most advisable site for
the proposed structure.&nbsp; A prospectus of a High Level Bridge
Company was issued in 1843, the names of George Stephenson and
George Hudson appearing on the committee of management, Robert
Stephenson being the consulting engineer.&nbsp; The project was
eventually taken up by the Newcastle and Darlington Railway
Company, and an Act for the construction of the bridge was
obtained in 1845.</p>
<p>The rapid extension of railways had given an extraordinary
stimulus to the art of bridge-building; the number of such
structures erected in Great Britain alone, since 1830, having
been above 25,000, or more than all that had before existed in
the country.&nbsp; Instead of the erection a single large bridge
constituting, as formerly, an epoch <!-- page 313--><a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>in
engineering, hundreds of extensive bridges of novel design were
simultaneously constructed.&nbsp; The necessity which existed for
carrying rigid roads, capable of bearing heavy railway trains at
high speeds, over extensive gaps free of support, rendered it
obvious that the methods which had up to that time been employed
for bridging space were altogether insufficient.&nbsp; The
railway engineer could not, like the ordinary road engineer,
divert his road and make choice of the best point for crossing a
river or a valley.&nbsp; He must take such ground as lay in the
line of his railway, be it bog, or mud, or shifting sand.&nbsp;
Navigable rivers and crowded thoroughfares had to be crossed
without interruption to the existing traffic, sometimes by
bridges at right angles to the river or road, sometimes by arches
more or less oblique.&nbsp; In many cases great difficulty arose
from the limited nature of the headway; but, as the level of the
original road must generally be preserved, and that of the
railway was in a measure fixed and determined, it was necessary
to modify the form and structure of the bridge, in almost every
case, in order to comply with the public requirements.&nbsp;
Novel conditions were met by fresh inventions, and difficulties
of the most unusual character were one after another successfully
surmounted.&nbsp; In executing these extraordinary works, iron
has been throughout the sheet-anchor of the engineer.&nbsp; In
its different forms of cast or wrought iron, it offered a
valuable resource, where rapidity of execution, great strength,
and cheapness of construction in the first instance, were
elements of prime importance; and by its skilful use, the railway
architect was enabled to achieve results which thirty years ago
would scarcely have been thought possible.</p>
<p>In many of the early cast-iron bridges the old form of the
arch was adopted, the stability of the structure depending wholly
on compression, the only novel feature being the use of iron
instead of stone.&nbsp; But in a large proportion of cases, the
arch, with the railroad over it, was found inapplicable in
consequence of the limited headway which it provided.&nbsp; <!--
page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>Hence it early occurred to George Stephenson, when
constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, to adopt the
simple cast-iron beam for the crossing of several roads and
canals along that line&mdash;this beam resembling in some measure
the lintel of the early temples&mdash;the pressure on the
abutments being purely vertical.&nbsp; One of the earliest
instances of this kind of bridge was that erected over Water
Street, Manchester, in 1829; after which, cast-iron girders, with
their lower webs considerably larger than their upper, were
ordinarily employed where the span was moderate; and wrought-iron
tie rods below were added to give increased strength where the
span was greater.</p>
<p>The next step was the contrivance of arched beams or bowstring
girders, firmly held together by horizontal ties to resist the
thrust, instead of abutments.&nbsp; Numerous excellent specimens
of this description of bridge were erected by Robert Stephenson
on the original London and Birmingham Railway; but by far the
grandest work of the kind&mdash;perfect as a specimen of modern
constructive skill&mdash;was the High Level Bridge, which we owe
to the genius of the same engineer.</p>
<p>The problem was, to throw a railway bridge across the deep
ravine which lies between the towns of Newcastle and Gateshead,
at the bottom of which flows the navigable river Tyne.&nbsp;
Along and up the sides of the valley&mdash;on the Newcastle bank
especially&mdash;run streets of old-fashioned houses, clustered
together in the strange forms peculiar to the older cities.&nbsp;
The ravine is of great depth&mdash;so deep and so gloomy-looking
towards dusk, that local tradition records that when the Duke of
Cumberland arrived late in the evening at the brow of the hill
overlooking the Tyne, on his way to Culloden, he exclaimed to his
attendants, on looking down into the black gorge before him,
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t think of taking me down
that coal-pit at this time of night!&rdquo;&nbsp; The road down
the Gateshead High Street is almost as steep as the roof of a
house, and up the Newcastle <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>Side, as
the street there is called, it is little better.&nbsp; During
many centuries the traffic north and south passed along this
dangerous and difficult route, over the old bridge which crosses
the river in the bottom of the valley.&nbsp; For about 30 years
the Newcastle Corporation had discussed various methods of
improving the communication between the towns; and the discussion
might have gone on for 30 years more, but for the advent of
railways, when the skill and enterprise to which they gave birth
speedily solved the difficulty and bridged the ravine.&nbsp; The
local authorities adroitly took advantage of the opportunity, and
insisted on the provision of a road for ordinary vehicles and
foot passengers in addition to the railroad.&nbsp; In this
circumstance originated one of the striking peculiarities of the
High Level Bridge, which serves two purposes, being a railway
above and a carriage roadway underneath.</p>
<p>The breadth of the river at the point of crossing is 515 feet,
but the length of the bridge and viaduct between the Gateshead
station and the terminus on the Newcastle side is about 4000
feet.&nbsp; It springs from Pipewell Gate Bank, on the south,
directly across to Castle Garth, where, nearly fronting the
bridge, stands the fine old Norman keep of the <i>New</i> Castle,
now nearly 800 years old, and a little beyond it is the spire of
St. Nicholas Church, with its light and graceful Gothic crown;
the whole forming a grand architectural group of unusual historic
interest.&nbsp; The bridge passes completely over the roofs of
the houses which fill both sides of the valley; and the
extraordinary height of the upper parapet, which is about 130
feet above the bed of the river, offers a prospect to the passing
traveller the like of which is perhaps nowhere else to be
seen.&nbsp; Far below are the queer chares and closes, the wynds
and lanes of old Newcastle; the water is crowded with pudgy,
black, coal keels; and, when there is a partial dispersion of the
great smoke clouds which usually obscure the sky, the funnels of
steamers and the masts of shipping may be seen far down the
river.&nbsp; The old bridge lies so far beneath that <!-- page
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>the passengers crossing it seem like so many bees
passing to and fro.</p>
<p>The first difficulty encountered in building the bridge was in
securing a solid foundation for the piers.&nbsp; The dimensions
of the piles to be driven were so huge, that the engineer found
it necessary to employ some extraordinary means for the
purpose.&nbsp; He called Nasmyth&rsquo;s Titanic steam-hammer to
his aid&mdash;the first occasion, we believe, on which this
prodigious power was employed in bridge pile-driving.&nbsp; A
temporary staging was erected for the steam-engine and hammer
apparatus, which rested on two keels, and, notwithstanding the
newness and stiffness of the machinery, the first pile was driven
on the 6th October, 1846, to a depth of 32 feet, in four
minutes.&nbsp; Two hammers of 30 cwt. each were kept in regular
use, making from 60 to 70 strokes a minute; and the results were
astounding to those who had been accustomed to the old style of
pile-driving by means of the ordinary pile-frame, consisting of
slide, ram, and monkey.&nbsp; By the old system, the pile was
driven by a comparatively small mass of iron descending with
great velocity from a considerable height&mdash;the velocity
being in excess and the mass deficient, and calculated, like the
momentum of a cannon-ball, rather for destructive than impulsive
action.&nbsp; In the case of the steam pile-driver, on the
contrary, the whole weight of a heavy mass is delivered rapidly
upon a driving-block of several tons weight placed directly over
the head of the pile, the weight never ceasing, and the blows
being repeated at the rate of a blow a second, until the pile is
driven home.&nbsp; It is a curious fact, that the rapid strokes
of the steam-hammer evolved so much heat, that on many occasions
the pile-head burst into flames during the process of
driving.&nbsp; The elastic force of steam is the power that lifts
the ram, the escape permitting its entire force to fall upon the
head of the driving block; while the steam above the piston on
the upper part of the cylinder, acting as a buffer or
recoil-spring, materially enhances the effect of the downward
<!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>blow.&nbsp; As soon as one pile was driven, the
traveller, hovering overhead, presented another, and down it went
into the solid bed of the river, with almost as much ease as a
lady sticks pins into a cushion.&nbsp; By the aid of this
powerful machine, pile-driving, formerly among the most costly
and tedious of engineering operations, became easy, rapid, and
comparatively economical.</p>
<p>When the piles had been driven and the coffer-dams formed and
puddled, the water within the enclosed spaces was pumped out by
the aid of powerful engines, so as, if possible, to lay bare the
bed of the river.&nbsp; Considerable difficulty was experienced
in getting in the foundations of the middle pier, in consequence
of the water forcing itself through the quicksand beneath as fast
as it was removed, This fruitless labour went on for months, and
many expedients were tried.&nbsp; Chalk was thrown in in large
quantities outside the piling, but without effect.&nbsp; Cement
concrete was at last put within the coffer-dam, until it set, and
the bottom was then found to be secure.&nbsp; A bed of concrete
was laid up to the level of the heads of the piles, the
foundation course of stone blocks being commenced about two feet
below low water, and the building proceeded without further
difficulty.&nbsp; It may serve to give an idea of the magnitude
of the work, when we state that 400,000 cubic feet of ashlar,
rubble, and concrete were worked up in the piers, and 450,000
cubic feet in the land-arches and approaches.</p>
<p>The most novel feature of the structure is the use of cast and
wrought iron in forming the double bridge, which admirably
combines the two principles of the arch and suspension; the
railway being carried over the back of the ribbed arches in the
usual manner, while the carriage-road and footpaths, forming a
long gallery or aisle, are suspended from these arches by
wrought-iron vertical rods, with horizontal tie-bars to resist
the thrust.&nbsp; The suspension-bolts are enclosed within
spandril pillars of cast iron, which give great stiffness to the
superstructure.&nbsp; This system of <!-- page 318--><a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>longitudinal and vertical bracing has been much
admired, for it not only accomplishes the primary object of
securing rigidity in the roadway, but at the same time, by its
graceful arrangement, heightens the beauty of the
structure.&nbsp; The arches consist of four main ribs, disposed
in pairs with a clear distance between the two inner arches of 20
feet 4 inches, forming the carriage-road, while between each of
the inner and outer ribs there is a space of 6 feet 2 inches,
constituting the footpaths.&nbsp; Each arch is cast in five
separate lengths or segments, strongly bolted together.&nbsp; The
ribs spring from horizontal plates of cast iron, bedded and
secured on the stone piers.&nbsp; All the abutting joints were
carefully executed by machinery, the fitting being of the most
perfect kind.&nbsp; In order to provide for the expansion and
contraction of the iron arching, and to preserve the equilibrium
of the piers without disturbance or racking of the other parts of
the bridge, it was arranged that the ribs of every two adjoining
arches resting on the same pier should be secured to the
springing-plates by keys and joggles; whilst on the next piers on
either side, the ribs remained free and were at liberty to expand
or contract according to temperature&mdash;a space being left for
the purpose.&nbsp; Hence each arch is complete and independent in
itself, the piers having simply to sustain their vertical
pressure.&nbsp; There are six arches of 125 feet span each; the
two approaches to the bridge being formed of cast-iron pillars
and bearers in keeping with the arches.</p>

<p>The result is a bridge that for massive solidity may be <!--
page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>pronounced unrivalled.&nbsp; It is perhaps the most
magnificent and striking of all the bridges to which railways
have given birth, and has been worthily styled &ldquo;the King of
railway structures.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a monument of the highest
engineering skill of our time, with the impress of power grandly
stamped upon it.&nbsp; It will also be observed, from the drawing
placed as the frontispiece of this book, that the High Level
Bridge forms a very fine object in a picture of great interest,
full of striking architectural variety and beauty.&nbsp; The
bridge was opened on the 15th August, 1849, and a few days after
the royal train passed over it, halting for a few minutes to
enable her Majesty to survey the wonderful scene below.&nbsp; In
the course of the following year the Queen opened the extensive
stone viaduct across the Tweed, above described, by which the
last link was completed of the continuous line of railway between
London and Edinburgh.&nbsp; Over the entrance to the Berwick
station, occupying the site of the once redoubtable Border
fortress, so often the deadly battle-ground of the ancient Scots
and English, was erected an arch under which the royal train
passed, bearing in large letters of gold the appropriate words,
&ldquo;<i>The last act of the Union</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warders at Berwick no longer look out from the castle
walls to descry the glitter of Southron spears.&nbsp; The
bell-tower, from which the alarm was sounded of old, though still
standing, is deserted; the only bell heard within the precincts
of the old castle being the railway porter&rsquo;s bell
announcing the arrival and departure of trains.&nbsp; You see the
Scotch express pass along the bridge and speed southward on the
wings of steam.&nbsp; But no alarm spreads along the border
now.&nbsp; Northumbrian beeves are safe.&nbsp; Chevy-Chase and
Otterburn are quiet sheep-pastures.&nbsp; The only men at arms on
the battlements of Alnwick Castle are of stone.&nbsp; Bamborough
Castle has become an asylum for shipwrecked mariners, and the
Norman Keep at Newcastle has been converted into a Museum of
Antiquities.&nbsp; The railway has indeed consummated the
Union.</p>

<span class="smcap">Robert Stephenson&rsquo;s Tubular Bridges at
Menai and Conway</span>.</h2>
<p>We have now to describe briefly another great undertaking,
begun by George Stephenson, and taken up and completed by his
son, in the course of which the latter carried out some of his
greatest works&mdash;we mean the Chester and Holyhead Railway,
completing the railway connection with Dublin, as the Newcastle
and Berwick line completed the connection with Edinburgh.&nbsp;
It will thus be seen how closely Telford was followed by the
Stephensons in perfecting the highways of their respective
epochs; the former by means of turnpike-roads, and the latter by
means of railways.</p>
<p>George Stephenson surveyed a line from Chester to Holyhead in
1838, and at the same time reported on the line through North
Wales to Port Dynllaen, proposed by the Irish Railway
Commissioners.&nbsp; His advice was strongly in favour of
adopting the line to Holyhead, as less costly and presenting
better gradients.&nbsp; A public meeting was held at Chester, in
January, 1839, in support of the latter measure, at which he was
present to give explanations.&nbsp; Mr. Uniacke, the Mayor, in
opening the proceedings, said that Mr. Stephenson was present,
ready to answer any questions which might be put to him on the
subject; and it was judiciously remarked that &ldquo;it would be
better that he should be asked questions than required to make a
speech; for, though a very good engineer, he was a bad
speaker.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the questions then put to Mr.
Stephenson related to the mode by which he proposed to haul the
passenger carriages over the Menai Suspension Bridge by <!-- page
321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>horse power; and he was asked whether he knew the
pressure the bridge was capable of sustaining.&nbsp; His answer
was, that &ldquo;he had not yet made any calculations; but he
proposed getting data which would enable him to arrive at an
accurate calculation of the actual strain upon the bridge during
the late gale.&nbsp; He had, however, no hesitation in saying
that it was more than twenty times as much as the strain of a
train of carriages and a locomotive engine.&nbsp; The only reason
why he proposed to convey the carriages over by horses, was in
order that he might, by distributing the weight, not increase the
wavy motion.&nbsp; All the train would be on at once; but
distributed.&nbsp; This he thought better than passing them,
linked together, by a locomotive engine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will
thus be observed that the practicability of throwing a rigid
railway bridge across the Straits had not yet been
contemplated.</p>
<p>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce passed resolutions in favour of
Stephenson&rsquo;s line, after hearing his explanation of its
essential features.&nbsp; The project, after undergoing much
discussion, was at length embodied in an Act passed in 1844; and
the work was brought to a successful completion by his son, with
several important modifications, including the grand original
feature of the tubular bridges across the Menai Straits and the
estuary of the Conway.&nbsp; Excepting these great works, the
construction of this line presented no unusual features; though
the remarkable terrace cut for the accommodation of the railway
under the steep slope of Penmaen Mawr is worthy of a passing
notice.</p>
<p>About midway between Conway and Bangor, Penmaen Mawr forms a
bold and almost precipitous headland, at the base of which, in
rough weather, the ocean dashes with great fury.&nbsp; There was
not space enough between the mountain and the strand for the
passage of the railway; hence in some places the rock had to be
blasted to form a terrace, and in others sea-walls had to be
built up to the proper level, on which to form an embankment of
sufficient <!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>width to enable the road to be
laid.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p322.jpg">
<img alt=

title=
"Penmaen Mawr.  (By Percival Skelton.)"
src="images/p322.jpg" />
</a> A tunnel 10&frac12; chains in length was cut through the
headland itself; and on its east and west sides the line was
formed by a terrace cut out of the cliff, and by embankments
protected by sea walls; the terrace being three times interrupted
by <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>embankments in its course of about 1&frac14;
mile.&nbsp; The road lies so close under the steep mountain face,
that it was even found necessary at certain places to protect it
against possible accidents from falling stones, by means of a
covered way.&nbsp; The terrace on the east side of the headland
was, however, in some measure protected against the roll of the
sea by the mass of stone run out from the tunnel, and forming a
deep shingle bank in front of the wall.</p>
<p>The part of the work which lies on the westward of the
headland penetrated by the tunnel, was exposed to the full force
of the sea; and the formation of the road at that point was
attended with great difficulty.&nbsp; While the sea wall was
still in progress, its strength was severely tried by a strong
north-westerly gale, which blew in October, 1846, with a spring
tide of 17 feet.&nbsp; On the following morning it was found that
a large portion of the rubble was irreparably injured, and 200
yards of the wall were then replaced by an open viaduct, with the
piers placed edgeways to the sea, the openings between them being
spanned by ten cast-iron girders each 42 feet long.&nbsp; This
accident induced the engineer to alter the contour of the sea
wall, so that it should present a diminished resistance to the
force of the waves.&nbsp; But the sea repeated its assaults, and
made further havoc with the work; entailing heavy expenses and a
complete reorganisation of the contract.&nbsp; Increased solidity
was then given to the masonry, and the face of the wall underwent
further change.&nbsp; At some points outworks were constructed,
and piles were driven into the beach about 15 feet from the base
of the wall, for the purpose of protecting its foundations and
breaking the force of the waves.&nbsp; The work was at length
finished after about three years&rsquo; anxious labour; but Mr.
Stephenson confessed that if a long tunnel had been made in the
first instance through the solid rock of Penmaen Mawr, a saving
of from &pound;25,000 to &pound;30,000 would have been
effected.&nbsp; He also said he had arrived at the conclusion
that in railway works engineers should endeavour as far as
possible to avoid the necessity of contending with <!-- page
324--><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>the sea; <a name="citation324"></a><a
href="#footnote324" class="citation">[324]</a> but if he were
ever again compelled to go within its reach, he would adopt,
instead of retaining walls, an open viaduct, placing all the
piers edgeways to the force of the sea, and allowing the waves to
break upon a natural slope of beach.&nbsp; He was ready enough to
admit the errors he had committed in the original design of this
work; but he said he had always gained more information from
studying the causes of failures and endeavouring to surmount them
than he had done from easily-won successes.&nbsp; Whilst many of
the latter had been forgotten, the former were indelibly fixed in
his memory.</p>
<p>But by far the greatest difficulty which Robert Stephenson had
to encounter in executing this railway, was in carrying it across
the Straits of Menai and the estuary of the Conway, where, like
his predecessor Telford when forming his high road through North
Wales, he was under the necessity of resorting to new and
altogether untried methods of bridge construction.&nbsp; At Menai
the waters of the Irish Sea are perpetually vibrating along the
precipitous shores of the strait; rising and falling from 20 to
25 feet at each successive tide; the width and depth of the
channel being such as to render it available for navigation by
the largest ships.&nbsp; The problem was, to throw a bridge
across this wide chasm&mdash;a bridge of unusual span and
dimensions&mdash;of such strength as to be capable of bearing the
heaviest loads at high speeds, and at such a uniform height
throughout as not in any way to interfere with the navigation of
the Strait.&nbsp; From an early period, Mr. Stephenson had fixed
upon the spot where the Britannia Rock occurs, nearly in the
middle of the channel, as the most eligible point for crossing;
the water-width from shore to shore at high <!-- page 325--><a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>water there
being about 1100 feet.&nbsp; His first idea was to construct the
bridge of two cast-iron arches, each of 350 feet span.&nbsp;
There was no novelty in this idea; for, as early as the year
1801, Mr. Rennie prepared a design of a cast-iron bridge across
the Strait at the Swilly rocks, the great centre arch of which
was to be 450 feet span; and at a later period, in 1810, Telford
submitted a design of a similar bridge at Inys-y-Moch, with a
single cast-iron arch of 500 feet.&nbsp; But the same objections
which led to the rejection of Rennie&rsquo;s and Telford&rsquo;s
designs, proved fatal to Robert Stephenson&rsquo;s, and his
iron-arched railway bridge was rejected by the Admiralty.&nbsp;
The navigation of the Strait was under no circumstances to be
interfered with; and even the erection of scaffolding from below,
to support the bridge during construction, was not to be
permitted.&nbsp; The idea of a suspension bridge was dismissed as
inapplicable; a degree of rigidity and strength, greater than
could be secured by any bridge constructed on the principle of
suspension, being considered an indispensable condition of the
proposed structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p325.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>Various other plans were suggested; but the whole
question remained unsettled even down to the time when the
Company went before Parliament, in 1844, for power to construct
the proposed bridges.&nbsp; No existing kind of structure seemed
to be capable of bearing the fearful extension to which rigid
bridges of the necessary spans would be subjected; and some new
expedient of engineering therefore became necessary.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson was then led to reconsider a design which he
had made in 1841 for a road bridge over the river Lea at Ware,
with a span of 50 feet,&mdash;the conditions only admitting of a
platform 18 or 20 inches thick.&nbsp; For this purpose a
wrought-iron platform was designed, consisting of a series of
simple cells, formed of boiler-plates riveted together with
angle-iron.&nbsp; The bridge was not, however, carried out after
this design, but was made of separate wrought-iron girders
composed of riveted plates.&nbsp; Recurring to his first idea of
this bridge, Mr. Stephenson thought that a stiff platform might
be constructed, with sides of strongly trussed frame-work of
wrought-iron, braced together at top and bottom with plates of
like material riveted together with angle-iron; and that such
platform might be suspended by strong chains on either side to
give it increased security.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was now,&rdquo; says
Mr. Stephenson, &ldquo;that I came to regard the tubular platform
as a beam, and that the chains should be looked upon as
auxiliaries.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appeared, nevertheless, that without
a system of diagonal struts inside, which of course would have
prevented the passage of trains <i>through</i> it, this kind of
structure was ill-suited for maintaining its form, and would be
very liable to become lozenge-shaped.&nbsp; Besides, the
rectangular figure was deemed objectionable, from the large
surface which it presented to the wind.</p>
<p>It then occurred to him that circular or elliptical tubes
might better answer the intended purpose; and in March, 1845, he
gave instructions to two of his assistants to prepare drawings of
such a structure, the tubes being made <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>with a
double thickness of plate at top and bottom.&nbsp; The results of
the calculations made as to the strength of such a tube, were
considered so satisfactory, that Mr. Stephenson says he
determined to fall back on a bridge of this description, on the
rejection of his design of the two cast-iron arches by the
Parliamentary Committee.&nbsp; Indeed, it became evident that a
tubular wrought-iron beam was the only structure which combined
the necessary strength and stability for a railway, with the
conditions deemed essential for the protection of the
navigation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stood,&rdquo; says Mr. Stephenson,
&ldquo;on the verge of a responsibility from which, I confess, I
had nearly shrunk.&nbsp; The construction of a tubular beam of
such gigantic dimensions, on a platform elevated and supported by
chains at such a height, did at first present itself as a
difficulty of a very formidable nature.&nbsp; Reflection,
however, satisfied me that the principles upon which the idea was
founded were nothing more than an extension of those daily in use
in the profession of the engineer.&nbsp; The method, moreover, of
calculating the strength of the structure which I had adopted,
was of the simplest and most elementary character; and whatever
might be the form of the tube, the principle on which the
calculations were founded was equally applicable, and could not
fail to lead to equally accurate results.&rdquo; <a
name="citation327"></a><a href="#footnote327"
class="citation">[327]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson accordingly
announced to the directors of the railway that he was prepared to
carry out a bridge of this general description, and they adopted
his views, though not without considerable misgivings.</p>
<p>While the engineer&rsquo;s mind was still occupied with the
subject, an accident occurred to the <i>Prince of Wales</i> iron
steamship, at Blackwall, which singularly corroborated his views
as to the strength of wrought-iron beams of large
dimensions.&nbsp; When this vessel was being launched, the cleet
on the bow gave way, in consequence of the bolts <!-- page
328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>breaking, and let the vessel down so that the bilge
came in contact with the wharf, and she remained suspended
between the water and the wharf for a length of about 110 feet,
but without any injury to the plates of the ship; satisfactorily
proving the great strength of this form of construction.&nbsp;
Thus, Mr. Stephenson became gradually confirmed in his opinion
that the most feasible method of bridging the strait at Menai and
the river at Conway was by means of a hollow beam of
wrought-iron.&nbsp; As the time was approaching for giving
evidence before Parliament on the subject, it was necessary for
him to settle some definite plan for submission to the
committee.&nbsp; &ldquo;My late revered father,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;having always taken a deep interest in the various
proposals which had been considered for carrying a railway across
the Menai Straits, requested me to explain fully to him the views
which led me to suggest the use of a tube, and also the nature of
the calculations I had made in reference to it.&nbsp; It was
during this personal conference that Mr. William Fairbairn
accidentally called upon me, to whom I also explained the
principles of the structure I had proposed.&nbsp; He at once
acquiesced in their truth, and expressed confidence in the
feasibility of my project, giving me at the same time some facts
relative to the remarkable strength of iron steamships, and
invited me to his works at Millwall, to examine the construction
of an iron steamship which was then in progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
date of this consultation was early in April, 1845, and Mr.
Fairbairn states that, on that occasion, &ldquo;Mr. Stephenson
asked whether such a design was practicable, and whether I could
accomplish it: and it was ultimately arranged that the subject
should be investigated experimentally, to determine not only the
value of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s original conception (of a
circular or egg-shaped wrought-iron tube, supported by chains),
but that of any other tubular form of bridge which might present
itself in the prosecution of my researches.&nbsp; The matter was
placed unreservedly in my hands; the entire conduct of the
investigation was entrusted to me; and, as <!-- page 329--><a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>an
experimenter, I was to be left free to exercise my own discretion
in the investigation of whatever forms or conditions of the
structure might appear to me best calculated to secure a safe
passage across the Straits.&rdquo; <a name="citation329a"></a><a
href="#footnote329a" class="citation">[329a]</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Fairbairn then proceeded to construct a number of experimental
models for the purpose of testing the strength of tubes of
different forms.&nbsp; The short period which elapsed, however,
before the bill was in committee, did not admit of much progress
being made with those experiments; but from the evidence in chief
given by Mr. Stephenson on the subject, on the 5th May following,
it appears that the idea which prevailed in his mind was that of
a bridge with openings of 450 feet (afterwards increased to 460
feet); with a roadway formed of a hollow wrought-iron beam, about
25 feet in diameter, presenting a rigid platform, suspended by
chains.&nbsp; At the same time, he expressed the confident
opinion that a tube of wrought iron would possess sufficient
strength and rigidity to support a railway train running inside
of it without the help of the chains.</p>
<p>While the bill was still in progress, Mr. Fairbairn proceeded
with his experiments.&nbsp; He first tested tubes of a
cylindrical form, in consequence of the favourable opinion
entertained by Mr. Stephenson of the tubes in that shape,
extending them subsequently to those of an elliptical form. <a
name="citation329b"></a><a href="#footnote329b"
class="citation">[329b]</a>&nbsp; He found tubes thus shaped more
or less defective, and proceeded to test those of a rectangular
kind.&nbsp; After the bill had received the royal assent on the
30th June, 1845, the directors of the company, with great
liberality, voted a sum for the purpose of enabling the
experiments to be <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>prosecuted, and upwards of
&pound;6000 were thus expended to make the assurance of their
engineer doubly sure.&nbsp; Mr. Fairbairn&rsquo;s tests were of
the most elaborate and eventually conclusive character, bringing
to light many new and important facts of great practical
value.&nbsp; The due proportions and thicknesses of the top,
bottom, and sides of the tubes were arrived at after a vast
number of trials; one of the results of the experiments being the
adoption of Mr. Fairbairn&rsquo;s invention of rectangular hollow
cells in the top of the beam for the purpose of giving it the
requisite degree of strength.&nbsp; About the end of August it
was thought desirable to obtain the assistance of a
mathematician, who should prepare a formula by which the strength
of a full-sized tube might be calculated from the results of the
experiments made with tubes of smaller dimensions.&nbsp;
Professor Hodgkinson was accordingly called in, and he proceeded
to verify and confirm the experiments which Mr. Fairbairn had
made, and afterwards reduced them to the required formula.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s time was so much engrossed with his
extensive engineering business that he was in a great measure
precluded from devoting himself to the consideration of the
practical details.&nbsp; The results of the experiments were
communicated to him from time to time, and were regarded by him
as exceedingly satisfactory.&nbsp; It would appear, however, that
while Mr. Fairbairn urged the rigidity and strength of the tubes
without the aid of chains, Mr. Stephenson had not quite made up
his mind upon the point.&nbsp; Mr. Hodgkinson, also, was strongly
inclined to retain them.&nbsp; Mr. Fairbairn held that it was
quite practicable to make the tubes &ldquo;sufficiently strong to
sustain not only their own weight, but, in addition to that load,
2000 tons equally distributed over the surface of the
platform,&mdash;a load ten times greater than they will ever be
called upon to support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thoroughly characteristic of Mr. Stephenson, and of the
caution with which he proceeded in every step of <!-- page
331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>this great undertaking&mdash;probing every inch of the
ground before he set down his foot upon it&mdash;that he should,
early in 1856, (<i>sic</i>) have appointed his able assistant,
Mr. Edwin Clark, to scrutinise carefully the results of every
experiment, and subject them to a separate and independent
analysis before finally deciding upon the form or dimensions of
the structure, or upon any mode of procedure connected with
it.&nbsp; At length Mr. Stephenson became satisfied that the use
of auxiliary chains was unnecessary, and that the tubular bridge
might be made of such strength as to be entirely
self-supporting.</p>
<p>While these important discussions were in progress, measures
were taken to proceed with the masonry of the bridges
simultaneously at Conway and the Menai Straits.&nbsp; The
foundation-stone of the Britannia Bridge was laid on the 10th
April, 1846; and on the 12th May following that of the Conway
Bridge was laid.&nbsp; Suitable platforms and workshops were also
erected for proceeding with the punching, fitting, and riveting
of the tubes; and when these operations were in full progress,
the neighbourhood of the Conway and Britannia Bridges presented
scenes of extraordinary bustle and industry.&nbsp; About 1500 men
were employed on the Britannia Bridge alone, and they mostly
lived upon the ground in wooden cottages erected for the
occasion.&nbsp; The iron plates were brought in ship-loads from
Liverpool, Anglesey marble from Penmon, and red sandstone from
Runcorn, in Cheshire, as wind and tide, and shipping and
convenience, might determine.&nbsp; There was an unremitting
clank of hammers, grinding of machinery, and blasting of rock,
going on from morning till night.&nbsp; In fitting the Britannia
tubes together, not less than 2,000,000 of bolts were riveted,
weighing some 900 tons.</p>
<p>The Britannia Bridge consists of two independent continuous
tubular beams, each 1511 feet in length, and each weighing 4680
tons, independent of the cast-iron frames inserted at their
bearings on the masonry of the towers.&nbsp; These immense beams
are supported at five places, namely, <!-- page 332--><a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>on the
abutments and on three towers, the central of which is known as
the Great Britannia Tower, 230 feet high, built on a rock in the
middle of the Strait.&nbsp; The side towers are 18 feet less in
height than the central one, and the abutment 35 feet lower than
the side towers.&nbsp; The design of the masonry is such as to
accord with the form of the tubes, being somewhat of an Egyptian
character, massive and gigantic rather than beautiful, but
bearing the unmistakable impress of power.</p>
<p>The bridge has four spans,&mdash;two of 460 feet over the
water, and two of 230 feet over the land.&nbsp; The weight of the
larger spans, at the points where the tubes repose on the
masonry, is not less than 1587 tons.&nbsp; On the centre tower
the tubes rest solid; but on the land towers and abutments they
lie on roller-beds, so as to allow of expansion and
contraction.&nbsp; The road within each tube is 15 feet wide, and
the height varies from 23 feet at the ends to 30 feet at the
centre.&nbsp; To give an idea of the vast size of the tubes by
comparison with other structures, it may be mentioned that each
length constituting the main spans is twice as long as London
Monument is high; and if it could be set on end in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, it would reach nearly 100 feet above the
cross.</p>
<p>The Conway Bridge is, in most respects, similar to the
Britannia, consisting of two tubes, of 400 feet span, placed side
by side, each weighing 1180 tons.&nbsp; The principle adopted in
the construction of the tubes, and the mode of floating and
raising them, were nearly the same as at the Britannia Bridge,
though the general arrangement of the plates is in many respects
different.</p>
<p>It was determined to construct the shorter outer tubes of the
Britannia Bridge on scaffoldings in the positions in which they
were permanently to remain, and to erect the larger tubes upon
wooden platforms at high-water-mark on the Caernarvon shore, from
whence they were to be floated in pontoons.</p>
<p>The floating of the tubes on pontoons, from the places <!--
page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>where they had been constructed, to the recesses in the
masonry of the towers, up which they were to be hoisted to the
positions they were permanently to occupy, was an anxious and
exciting operation.&nbsp; The first part of this process was
performed at Conway, where Mr. Stephenson directed it in person,
assisted by Captain Claxton, Mr. Brunel, and other engineering
friends.&nbsp; On the 6th March, 1848, the pontoons bearing the
first great tube of the up-line were floated round quietly and
majestically into their place between the towers in about twenty
minutes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one of the sets of pontoons had
become slightly slued by the stream, by which the Conway end of
the tube was prevented from being brought home; and five anxious
days to all concerned intervened before it could be set in its
place.&nbsp; In the mean time, the presses and raising machinery
had been fitted in the towers above, and the lifting process was
begun on the 8th April, when the immense mass was raised 8 feet,
at the rate of about 2 inches a minute.&nbsp; On the 16th, the
tube had been raised and finally lowered into its permanent bed;
the rails were laid along it; and, on the 18th, Mr. Stephenson
passed through with the first locomotive.&nbsp; The second tube
was proceeded with on the removal of the first from the platform,
and was completed and floated in seven months.&nbsp; The rapidity
with which this second tube was constructed was in no small
degree owing to the Jacquard punching-machine, contrived for the
purpose by Mr. Roberts of Manchester.&nbsp; This tube was finally
fixed in its permanent bed on the 2nd of January, 1849.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The floating and fixing of the great Britannia tubes was a
still more formidable enterprise, though the experience gained at
Conway rendered it easy compared with what it otherwise would
have been.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson superintended the operation of
floating the first in person, giving the arranged signals from
the top of the tube on which he was mounted, the active part of
the business being performed by a numerous corps of sailors,
under the immediate <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>direction of Captain Claxton.&nbsp;
Thousands of spectators lined the shores of the Strait on the
evening of the 19th June, 1849.&nbsp; On the land attachments
being cut, the pontoons began to float off; but one of the
capstans having given way from excessive strain, the tube was
brought home again for the night.&nbsp; By next morning the
defective capstan was restored, and all was in readiness for
another trial.&nbsp; At half-past seven in the evening the tube
was afloat, and the pontoons swung out into the current like a
monster pendulum, held steady by the shore guide-lines, but
increasing in speed to almost a fearful extent as they <!-- page
335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>neared their destined place between the piers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The success of this operation,&rdquo; says Mr. Clark,
&ldquo;depended mainly on properly striking the
&lsquo;butt&rsquo; beneath the Anglesey tower, on which, as upon
a centre, the tube was to be veered round into its position
across the opening.&nbsp; This position was determined by a
12-inch line, which was to be paid out to a fixed mark from the
Llanfair capstan.&nbsp; The coils of the rope unfortunately
over-rode each other upon this capstan, so that it could not be
paid out.&nbsp; In resisting the motion of the tube, the capstan
was bodily dragged out of the platform by the action of the
palls, and the tube was in imminent danger of being carried away
by the stream, or the pontoons crushed upon the rocks.&nbsp; The
men at the capstan were all knocked down, and some of them thrown
into the water, though they made every exertion to arrest the
motion of the capstan-bars.&nbsp; In this dilemma Mr. Rolfe, who
had charge of the capstan, with great presence of mind, called
the visitors on shore to his assistance; and handing out the
spare coil of the 12-inch line into the field at the back of the
capstan, it was carried with great rapidity up the field, and a
crowd of people, men, women, and children, holding on to this
huge cable, arresting the progress of the tube, which was at
length brought safely against the butt and veered round.&nbsp;
The Britannia end was then drawn into the recess of the masonry
by a chain passing through the tower to a crab on the far
side.&nbsp; The violence of the tide abated, though the wind
increased, and the Anglesey end was drawn into its place beneath
the corbelling in the masonry; and as the tide went down, the
pontoons deposited their valuable cargo on the welcome shelf at
each end.&nbsp; The successful issue was greeted by cannon from
the shore and the hearty cheers of many thousands of spectators,
whose sympathy and anxiety were but too clearly indicated by the
unbroken silence with which the whole operation had been
accompanied.&rdquo; <a name="citation335"></a><a
href="#footnote335" class="citation">[335]</a>&nbsp; By <!-- page
336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>midnight all the pontoons had been got clear of the
tube, which now hung suspended over the waters of the Strait by
its two ends, which rested upon the edges cut in the rock for the
purpose at the base of the Britannia and Anglesey towers
respectively, up which the tube had now to be lifted by hydraulic
power to its permanent place near the summit.&nbsp; The accuracy
with which the gigantic beam had been constructed may be inferred
from the fact that, after passing into its place, a clear space
remained between the iron plating and the rock outside of it of
only about three-quarters of an inch!</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s anxiety was, of course, very great up
to the time of performing this trying operation.&nbsp; When he
had got the first tube floated at Conway, and saw all safe, he
said to Captain Moorsom, &ldquo;Now I shall go to
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Britannia Bridge was a still more
difficult enterprise, and cost him many a sleepless night.&nbsp;
Afterwards describing his feelings to his friend Mr. Gooch, he
said: &ldquo;It was a most anxious and harassing time with
me.&nbsp; Often at night I would lie tossing about, seeking sleep
in vain.&nbsp; The tubes filled my head.&nbsp; I went to bed with
them and got up with them.&nbsp; In the grey of the morning, when
I looked across the Square, <a name="citation336"></a><a
href="#footnote336" class="citation">[336]</a> it seemed an
immense distance across to the houses on the opposite side.&nbsp;
It was nearly the same length as the span of my tubular
bridge!&rdquo;&nbsp; When the first tube had been floated, a
friend observed to him, &ldquo;This great work has made you ten
years older.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not slept sound,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;for three weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir F. Head,
however relates, that when he revisited the spot on the following
morning, he observed, sitting on a platform overlooking the
suspended tube, a gentleman, reclining entirely by himself,
smoking a cigar, and gazing, as if indolently, at the a&euml;rial
gallery beneath him.&nbsp; It was the engineer himself,
contemplating his new born child.&nbsp; He had strolled down from
<!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>the neighbouring village, after his first sound and
refreshing sleep for weeks, to behold in sunshine and solitude,
that which during a weary period of gestation had been either
mysteriously moving in his brain, or, like a
vision&mdash;sometimes of good omen, and sometimes of
evil&mdash;had, by night as well as by day, been flitting across
his mind.</p>
<p>The next process was the lifting of the tube into its place,
which was performed very deliberately and cautiously.&nbsp; It
was raised by powerful hydraulic presses, only a few feet at a
time, and carefully under-built, before being raised to a farther
height.&nbsp; When it had been got up by successive stages of
this kind to about 24 feet, an extraordinary accident occurred,
during Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s absence in London, which he
afterwards described to the author in as nearly as possible the
following words:&mdash;&ldquo;In a work of such novelty and
magnitude, you may readily imagine how anxious I was that every
possible contingency should be provided for.&nbsp; Where one
chain or rope was required, I provided two.&nbsp; I was not
satisfied with &lsquo;enough:&rsquo; I must have absolute
security, as far as that was possible.&nbsp; I knew the
consequences of failure would be most disastrous to the Company,
and that the wisest economy was to provide for all contingencies
at whatever cost.&nbsp; When the first tube at the Britannia had
been successfully floated between the piers, ready for being
raised, my young engineers were very much elated; and when the
hoisting apparatus had been fixed, they wrote to me
saying,&mdash;&lsquo;We are now all ready for raising her: we
could do it in a day, or in two at the most.&nbsp; But my reply
was, &lsquo;No: you must only raise the tube inch by inch, and
you must build up under it as you rise.&nbsp; Every inch must be
made good.&nbsp; Nothing must be left to chance or good
luck.&rsquo;&nbsp; And fortunate it was that I insisted upon this
cautious course being pursued; for, one day, while the hydraulic
presses were at work, the bottom of one of them burst clean
away!&nbsp; The crosshead and the chains, weighing more than 50
tons, descended with a fearful crash upon the press, and the tube
itself fell down upon the packing <!-- page 338--><a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>beneath.&nbsp; Though the fall of the tube was not more
than nine inches, it crushed solid castings, weighing tons, as if
they had been nuts.&nbsp; The tube itself was slightly strained
and deflected, though it still remained sufficiently
serviceable.&nbsp; But it was a tremendous test to which it was
put, for a weight of upwards of 5000 tons falling even a few
inches must be admitted to be a very serious matter.&nbsp; That
it stood so well was extraordinary.&nbsp; Clark immediately wrote
me an account of the circumstance, in which he said, &lsquo;Thank
God, you have been so obstinate.&nbsp; For if this accident had
occurred without a bed for the end of the tube to fall on, the
whole would now have been lying across the bottom of the
Straits.&rsquo;&nbsp; Five thousand pounds extra expense was
caused by this accident, slight though it might seem.&nbsp; But
careful provision was made against future failure; a new and
improved cylinder was provided: and the work was very soon
advancing satisfactorily towards completion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Queen first visited the Britannia Bridge, on her
return from the North in 1852, Robert Stephenson accompanied Her
Majesty and Prince Albert over the works, explaining the
principles on which the bridge had been built, and the
difficulties which had attended its erection.&nbsp; He conducted
the Royal party to near the margin of the sea, and, after
describing to them the incident of the fall of the tube, and the
reason of its preservation, he pointed with pardonable pride to a
pile of stones which the workmen had there raised to commemorate
the event.&nbsp; While nearly all the other marks of the work
during its progress had been obliterated, that cairn had been
left standing in commemoration of the caution and foresight of
their chief.</p>
<p>The floating and raising of the remaining tubes need not be
described in detail.&nbsp; The second was floated on the 3rd
December, and set in its permanent place on the 7th January,
1850.&nbsp; The others were floated and raised in due
course.&nbsp; On the 5th March, Mr. Stephenson put the last rivet
in the <!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>last tube, and passed through the
completed bridge, accompanied by about a thousand persons, drawn
by three locomotives.&nbsp; The bridge was opened for public
traffic on the 18th March.&nbsp; The cost of the whole work was
&pound;234,450.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Britannia Bridge is one of the most remarkable monuments
of the enterprise and skill of the present century.&nbsp; Robert
Stephenson was the master spirit of the undertaking.&nbsp; To him
belongs the merit of first seizing the ideal <!-- page 340--><a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>conception
of the structure best adapted to meet the necessities of the
case; and of selecting the best men to work out his idea, himself
watching, controlling, and testing every result, by independent
check and counter-check.&nbsp; And finally, he organised and
directed, through his assistants, the vast band of skilled
workmen and labourers who were for so many years occupied in
carrying his magnificent original conception to a successful
practical issue.&nbsp; As he himself said of the
work,&mdash;&ldquo;The true and accurate calculation of all the
conditions and elements essential to the safety of the bridge had
been a source not only of mental but of bodily toil; including,
as it did, a combination of abstract thought and well-considered
experiment adequate to the magnitude of the project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Britannia Bridge was the result of a vast combination of
skill and industry.&nbsp; But for the perfection of our tools and
the ability of our mechanics to use them to the greatest
advantage; but for the matured powers of the steam-engine; but
for the improvements in the iron manufacture, which enabled
blooms to be puddled of sizes before deemed impracticable, and
plates and bars of immense size to be rolled and forged; but for
these, the Britannia Bridge would have been designed in
vain.&nbsp; Thus, it was not the product of the genius of the
railway engineer alone, but of the collective mechanical genius
of the English nation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">George Stephenson&rsquo;s Closing
Years</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Illness and
Death</span>.</h2>
<p>In describing the completion of the series of great works
detailed in the preceding chapter, we have somewhat anticipated
the closing years of George Stephenson&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; He
could not fail to take an anxious interest in the success of his
son&rsquo;s designs, and he accordingly paid many visits to
Conway and to Menai, during the progress of the works.&nbsp; He
was present on the occasion of the floating and raising of the
first Conway tube, and there witnessed a clear proof of the
soundness of Robert&rsquo;s judgment as to the efficiency and
strength of the tubular bridge, of which he had at first
expressed some doubts; but before the like test could be applied
at the Britannia Bridge, George Stephenson&rsquo;s mortal
anxieties were at an end, for he had then ceased from all his
labours.</p>
<p>Towards the close of his life, George Stephenson almost
entirely withdrew from the active pursuit of his profession; <!--
page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>he devoted himself chiefly to his extensive collieries
and lime-works, taking a local interest only in such projected
railways as were calculated to open up new markets for their
products.</p>
<p>At home he lived the life of a country gentleman, enjoying his
garden and grounds, and indulging his love of nature, which,
through all his busy life, had never left him.&nbsp; It was not
until the year 1845 that he took an active interest in
horticultural pursuits.&nbsp; Then he began to build new
melon-houses, pineries, and vineries, of great extent; and he now
seemed as eager to excel all other growers of exotic plants in
his neighbourhood, as he had been to surpass the villagers of
Killingworth in the production of gigantic cabbages and
cauliflowers some thirty years before.&nbsp; He had a pine-house
built 68 feet in length and a pinery 140 feet.&nbsp; Workmen were
constantly employed in enlarging them, until at length he had no
fewer than ten glass forcing-houses, heated with hot water, which
he was one of the first in that neighbourhood to make use of for
such a purpose.&nbsp; He did not take so much pleasure in flowers
as in fruits.&nbsp; At one of the county agricultural meetings,
he said that he intended yet to grow pineapples at Tapton as big
as pumpkins.&nbsp; The only man to whom he would &ldquo;knock
under&rdquo; was his friend Paxton, the gardener to the Duke of
Devonshire; and he was so old in the service, and so skilful,
that he could scarcely hope to beat him.&nbsp; Yet his
&ldquo;Queen&rdquo; pines did take the first prize at a
competition with the Duke,&mdash;though this was not until
shortly after his death, when the plants had become more fully
grown.&nbsp; His grapes also took the first prize at Rotherham,
at a competition open to all England.&nbsp; He was extremely
successful in producing melons, having invented a method of
suspending them in baskets of wire gauze, which, by relieving the
stalk from tension, allowed nutrition to proceed more freely, and
better enabled the fruit to grow and ripen.</p>
<p>He took much pride also in his growth of cucumbers.&nbsp; He
raised them very fine and large, but he could not make <!-- page
343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>them grow straight.&nbsp; Place them as he would,
notwithstanding all his propping of them, and humouring them by
modifying the application of heat and the admission of light for
the purpose of effecting his object, they would still insist on
growing crooked in their own way.&nbsp; At last he had a number
of glass cylinders made at Newcastle, for the purpose of an
experiment; into these the growing cucumbers were inserted, and
then he succeeded in growing them perfectly straight.&nbsp;
Carrying one of the new products into his house one day, and
exhibiting it to a party of visitors, he told them of the
expedient he had adopted, and added gleefully, &ldquo;I think I
have bothered them noo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson also carried on farming operations with some
success.&nbsp; He experimented on manure, and fed cattle after
methods of his own.&nbsp; He was very particular as to breed and
build in stock-breeding.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; he
said to one gentleman, &ldquo;I like to see the
<i>coo&rsquo;s</i> back at a gradient something like this&rdquo;
(drawing an imaginary line with his hand), &ldquo;and then the
ribs or girders will carry more flesh than if they were
so&mdash;or so.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he attended the county
agricultural meetings, which he frequently did, he was accustomed
to take part in the discussions, and he brought the same vigorous
practical mind to bear upon questions of tillage, drainage, and
farm economy, which he had been accustomed to exercise on
mechanical and engineering matters.</p>
<p>All his early affection for birds and animals revived.&nbsp;
He had favourite dogs, and cows, and horses; and again he began
to keep rabbits, and to pride himself on the beauty of his
breed.&nbsp; There was not a bird&rsquo;s nest upon the grounds
that he did not know of; and from day to day he went round
watching the progress which the birds made with their building,
carefully guarding them from injury.&nbsp; No one was more
minutely acquainted with the habits of British birds, the result
of a long, loving, and close observation of nature.</p>
<p><!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>At Tapton he remembered the failure of his early
experiment in hatching birds&rsquo; eggs by heat, and he now
performed it successfully, being able to secure a proper
apparatus for maintaining a uniform temperature.&nbsp; He was
also curious about the breeding and fattening of fowls; and when
his friend Edward Pease of Darlington visited him at Tapton, he
explained a method which he had invented for fattening chickens
in half the usual time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stephenson tried to keep bees, but found they would not
thrive at Tapton.&nbsp; Many hives perished, and there was no
case of success.&nbsp; The cause of failure was a puzzle to the
engineer; but one day his acute powers of observation enabled him
to unravel it.&nbsp; At the foot of the hill on which Tapton
House stands, he saw some bees trying to rise up from amongst the
grass, laden with honey and wax.&nbsp; They were already
exhausted, as if with long flying; and then it occurred to him
that the height at which the house stood above the bees&rsquo;
feeding-ground rendered it difficult for them to reach their
hives when heavy laden, and hence they sank exhausted.&nbsp; He
afterwards incidentally mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Jesse
the naturalist, who concurred in his view as to the cause of
failure, and was much struck by the keen observation which had
led to its solution.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson had none of the in-door habits of the
student.&nbsp; He read very little; for reading is a habit which
is generally acquired in youth; and his youth and manhood had
been for the most part spent in hard work.&nbsp; Books wearied
him, and sent him to sleep.&nbsp; Novels excited his feelings too
much, and he avoided them, though he would occasionally read
through a philosophical book on a subject in which he felt
particularly interested.&nbsp; He wrote very few letters with his
own hand; nearly all his letters were dictated, and he avoided
even dictation when he could.&nbsp; His greatest pleasure was in
conversation, from which he gathered most of his imparted
information.</p>
<p>It was his practice, when about to set out on a journey by
<!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>railway, to walk along the train before it started, and
look into the carriages to see if he could find &ldquo;a
conversable face.&rdquo;&nbsp; On one of these occasions, at the
Euston Station, he discovered in a carriage a very handsome,
manly, and intelligent face, which he afterwards found was that
of the late Lord Denman.&nbsp; He was on his way down to his seat
at Stony Middleton, in Derbyshire.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson entered
the carriage, and the two were shortly engaged in interesting
conversation.&nbsp; It turned upon chronometry and horology, and
the engineer amazed his lordship by the extent of his knowledge
on the subject, in which he displayed as much minute information,
even down to the latest improvements in watchmaking, as if he had
been bred a watchmaker and lived by the trade.&nbsp; Lord Denman
was curious to know how a man whose time must have been mainly
engrossed by engineering, had gathered so much knowledge on a
subject quite out of his own line, and he asked the
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;I learnt clockmaking and
watchmaking,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;while a working man at
Killingworth, when I made a little money in my spare hours, by
cleaning the pitmen&rsquo;s clocks and watches; and since then I
have kept up my information on the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; This led
to further questions, and then Mr. Stephenson told Lord Denman
the interesting story of his life, which held him entranced
during the remainder of the journey.</p>
<p>Many of his friends readily accepted invitations to Tapton
House to enjoy his hospitality, which never failed.&nbsp; With
them he would &ldquo;fight his battles o&rsquo;er again,&rdquo;
reverting to his battle for the locomotive; and he was never
tired of telling, nor were his auditors of listening to, the
lively anecdotes with which he was accustomed to illustrate the
struggles of his early career.&nbsp; Whilst walking in the woods
or through the grounds, he would arrest his friend&rsquo;s
attention by allusion to some simple object,&mdash;such as a
leaf, a blade of grass, a bit of bark, a nest of birds, or an ant
carrying its eggs across the path,&mdash;and descant in glowing
terms upon the creative power of the Divine Mechanician, <!--
page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>whose contrivances were so exhaustless and so
wonderful.&nbsp; This was a theme upon which he was often
accustomed to dwell in reverential admiration, when in the
society of his more intimate friends.</p>
<p>One night, when walking under the stars, and gazing up into
the field of suns, each the probable centre of a system, forming
the Milky Way, a friend said to him, &ldquo;What an insignificant
creature is man in sight of so immense a creation as
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; was his reply; &ldquo;but
how wonderful a creature also is man, to be able to think and
reason, and even in some measure to comprehend works so
infinite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A microscope, which he had brought down to Tapton, was a
source of immense enjoyment to him; and he was never tired of
contemplating the minute wonders which it revealed.&nbsp; One
evening, when some friends were visiting him, he induced them
each to puncture their skin so as to draw blood, in order that he
might examine the globules through the microscope.&nbsp; One of
the gentlemen present was a teetotaller, and Mr. Stephenson
pronounced his blood to be the most lively of the whole.&nbsp; He
had a theory of his own about the movement of the globules in the
blood, which has since become familiar.&nbsp; It was, that they
were respectively charged with electricity, positive at one end
and negative at the other, and that thus they attracted and
repelled each other, causing a circulation.&nbsp; No sooner did
he observe anything new, than he immediately set about devising a
reason for it.&nbsp; His training in mechanics, his practical
familiarity with matter in all its forms, and the strong bent of
his mind, led him first of all to seek for a mechanical
explanation.&nbsp; And yet he was ready to admit that there was a
something in the principle of <i>life</i>&mdash;so mysterious and
inexplicable&mdash;which baffled mechanics, and seemed to
dominate over and control them.&nbsp; He did not care much,
either, for abstruse mechanics, but only for the experimental and
practical, as is usually the case with those whose knowledge has
been self-acquired.</p>
<p>Even at his advanced age, the spirit of frolic had not left
<!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>him.&nbsp; When proceeding from Chesterfield station to
Tapton House with his friends, he would almost invariably
challenge them to a race up the steep path, partly formed of
stone steps, along the hill side.&nbsp; And he would struggle, as
of old, to keep the front place, though by this time his
&ldquo;wind&rdquo; had greatly failed.&nbsp; He would
occasionally invite an old friend to take a quiet wrestle with
him on the lawn, to keep up his skill, and perhaps to try some
new &ldquo;knack&rdquo; of throwing.&nbsp; In the evening, he
would sometimes indulge his visitors by reciting the old pastoral
of &ldquo;Damon and Phyllis,&rdquo; or singing his favourite song
of &ldquo;John Anderson my Joe.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his greatest
glory amongst those with whom he was most intimate, was a
&ldquo;crowdie!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a crowdie
night,&rdquo; he would say; and forthwith a kettle of boiling
water was ordered in, with a basin of oatmeal.&nbsp; Taking a
large bowl, containing a sufficiency of hot water, and placing it
between his knees, he poured in oatmeal with one hand, and
stirred the mixture vigorously with the other.&nbsp; When enough
meal had been added, and the stirring was completed, the crowdie
was made.&nbsp; It was then supped <!-- page 348--><a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>with new
milk, and Stephenson generally pronounced it
&ldquo;capital!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the diet to which he had been
accustomed when a working man, and all the dainties with which he
had become familiar in recent years had not spoiled his simple
tastes.&nbsp; To enjoy crowdie at his age, besides, indicated
that he still possessed that quality on which no doubt much of
his practical success in life had depended,&mdash;a strong and
healthy digestion.</p>
<p>He would also frequently invite to his house the humbler
companions of his early life, and take pleasure in talking over
old times with them.&nbsp; He never assumed any of the bearings
of a great man on such occasions, but treated the visitors with
the same friendliness and respect as if they had been his equals,
sending them away pleased with themselves and delighted with
him.&nbsp; At other times, needy men who had known him in youth
would knock at his door, and they were never refused
access.&nbsp; But if he had heard of any misconduct on their part
he would rate them soundly.&nbsp; One who knew him intimately in
private life has seen him exhorting such backsliders, and
denouncing their misconduct and imprudence with the tears
streaming down his cheeks.&nbsp; And he would generally conclude
by opening his purse, and giving them the help which they needed
&ldquo;to make a fresh start in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s life at Tapton during his latter years
was occasionally diversified with a visit to London.&nbsp; His
engineering business having become limited, he generally went
there for the purpose of visiting friends, or &ldquo;to see what
there was fresh going on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found a new race of
engineers springing up on all hands&mdash;men who knew him not;
and his London journeys gradually ceased to yield him
pleasure.&nbsp; A friend used to take him to the opera, but by
the end of the first act, he was generally in a profound
slumber.&nbsp; Yet on one occasion he enjoyed a visit to the
Haymarket with a party of friends on his birthday, to see T. P.
Cooke, in &ldquo;Black-eyed Susan;&rdquo;&mdash;if that can be
called enjoyment which kept him in a state of tears during <!--
page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>half the performance.&nbsp; At other times he visited
Newcastle, which always gave him great pleasure.&nbsp; He would,
on such occasions, go out to Killingworth and seek up old
friends, and if the people whom he knew were too retiring, and
shrunk into their cottages, he went and sought them there.&nbsp;
Striking the floor with his stick, and holding his noble person
upright, he would say, in his own kind way, &ldquo;Well, and
how&rsquo;s all here to-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; To the last he had
always a warm heart for Newcastle and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel, on more than one occasion, invited George
Stephenson to his mansion at Drayton, where he was accustomed to
assemble round him men of the highest distinction in art,
science, and legislation, during the intervals of his
parliamentary life.&nbsp; The first invitation was respectfully
declined.&nbsp; Sir Robert invited him a second time, and a
second time he declined: &ldquo;I have no great ambition,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to mix in fine company, and perhaps should feel
out of my element amongst such high folks.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Sir
Robert a third time pressed him to come down to Tamworth early in
January, 1845, when he would meet Buckland, Follett, and others
well known to both.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Sir Robert,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I feel your kindness very much, and can no longer
refuse: I will come down and join your party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s strong powers of observation, together
with his native humour and shrewdness, imparted to his
conversation at all times much vigour and originality, and made
him, to young and old, a delightful companion.&nbsp; Though
mainly an engineer, he was also a profound thinker on many
scientific questions: and there was scarcely a subject of
speculation, or a department of recondite science, on which he
had not employed his faculties in such a way as to have formed
large and original views.&nbsp; At Drayton, the conversation
usually turned upon such topics, and Mr. Stephenson freely joined
in it.&nbsp; On one occasion, an animated discussion took place
between himself and Dr. Buckland on one of his favourite theories
as to the <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>formation of coal.&nbsp; But the
result was, that Dr. Buckland, a much greater master of
tongue-fence than Mr. Stephenson, completely silenced him.&nbsp;
Next morning, before breakfast, when he was walking in the
grounds, deeply pondering, Sir William Follett came up and asked
what he was thinking about?&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Sir William, I am
thinking over that argument I had with Buckland last night; I
know I am right, and that if I had only the command of words
which he has, I&rsquo;d have beaten him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
me know all about it,&rdquo; said Sir William, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two sat
down in an arbour, and the astute lawyer made himself thoroughly
acquainted with the points of the case; entering into it with all
the zeal of an advocate about to plead the dearest interests of
his client.&nbsp; After he had mastered the subject, Sir William
rose up, rubbing his hands with glee, and said, &ldquo;Now I am
ready for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel was made acquainted
with the plot, and adroitly introduced the subject of the
controversy after dinner.&nbsp; The result was, that in the
argument which followed, the man of science was overcome by the
man of law; and Sir William Follett had at all points the mastery
over Dr. Buckland.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say, Mr.
Stephenson?&rdquo; asked Sir Robert, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will only say this, that of
all the powers above and under the earth, there seems to me to be
no power so great as the gift of the gab.&rdquo; <a
name="citation350"></a><a href="#footnote350"
class="citation">[350]</a></p>
<p>One Sunday, when the party had just returned from church, they
were standing together on the terrace near the Hall, and observed
in the distance a railway-train flashing along, tossing behind
its long white plume of steam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Buckland,&rdquo;
said Stephenson, &ldquo;I have a poser for you.&nbsp; Can you
tell me what is the power that is driving that
train?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I
suppose it is one of your big engines.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what drives the engine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, very likely a

do you say to the light of the sun?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How can
that be?&rdquo; asked the doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is nothing
else,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;it is light bottled up in
the earth for tens of thousands of years,&mdash;light, absorbed
by plants and vegetables, being necessary for the condensation of
carbon during the process of their growth, if it be not carbon in
another form,&mdash;and now, after being buried in the earth for
long ages in fields of coal, that latent light is again brought
forth and liberated, made to work as in that locomotive, for
great human purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the same visit, Mr. Stephenson, one evening repeated
his experiment with blood drawn from the finger, submitting it to
the microscope in order to show the curious circulation of the
globules.&nbsp; He set the example by pricking his own thumb; and
the other guests, by turns, in like manner, gave up a small
portion of their blood for the purpose of ascertaining the
comparative livelinesss of their circulation.&nbsp; When Sir
Robert Peel&rsquo;s turn came, Mr. Stephenson said he was curious
to know &ldquo;how the blood globules of a great politician would
conduct themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Robert held forth his finger
for the purpose of being pricked; but once, and again, he
sensitively shrunk back, and at length the experiment, so far as
he was concerned, was abandoned.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
sensitiveness to pain was extreme, and yet he was destined, a few
years after, to die a death of the most distressing agony.</p>
<p>In 1847, the year before his death, Mr. Stephenson was again
invited to join a distinguished party at Drayton Manor, and to
assist in the ceremony of formally opening the Trent Valley
Railway, which had been originally designed and laid out by
himself many years before.&nbsp; The first sod of the railway had
been cut by the Prime Minister, in November, 1845, during the
time when Mr. Stephenson was abroad on the business of the
Spanish railway.&nbsp; The formal opening took place on the 26th
June, 1847, the line having thus been constructed in less than
two years.</p>
<p>What a change had come over the spirit of the landed <!-- page
352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>gentry since the time when George Stephenson had first
projected a railway through that district!&nbsp; Then they were
up in arms against him, characterising him as the devastator and
spoiler of their estates; now he was hailed as one of the
greatest benefactors of the age.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel, the chief
political personage in England, welcomed him as a guest and
friend, and spoke of him as the chief among practical
philosophers.&nbsp; A dozen members of Parliament, seven
baronets, with all the landed magnates of the district, assembled
to celebrate the opening of the railway.&nbsp; The clergy were
there to bless the enterprise, and to bid all hail to railway
progress, as &ldquo;enabling them to carry on with greater
facility those operations in connexion with religion which were
calculated to be so beneficial to the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
army, speaking through the mouth of General A&rsquo;Court,
acknowledged the vast importance of railways, as tending to
improve the military defences of the country.&nbsp; And
representatives from eight corporations were there to acknowledge
the great benefits which railways had conferred upon the
merchants, tradesmen, and working classes of their respective
towns and cities.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1848 Mr. Stephenson was invited to
Whittington House, near Chesterfield, the residence of his friend
and former pupil, Mr. Swanwick, to meet the distinguished
American, Emerson.&nbsp; Upon being introduced, they did not
immediately engage in conversation; but presently Stephenson
jumped up, took Emerson by the collar, and giving him one of his
friendly shakes, asked how it was that in England we could always
tell an American?&nbsp; This led to an interesting conversation,
in the course of which Emerson said how much he had been
everywhere struck by the haleness and comeliness of the English
men and women; and then they diverged into a further discussion
of the influences which air, climate, moisture, soil, and other
conditions exercised upon the physical and moral development of a
people.&nbsp; The conversation was next directed to the subject
of electricity, <!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>upon which Stephenson launched out
enthusiastically, explaining his views by several simple and
striking illustrations.&nbsp; From thence it gradually turned to
the events of his own life, which he related in so graphic a
manner as completely to rivet the attention of the
American.&nbsp; Afterwards Emerson said, &ldquo;that it was worth
crossing the Atlantic to have seen Stephenson alone; he had such
native force of character and vigour of intellect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s days were spent quietly at
Tapton, amongst his dogs, his rabbits, and his birds.&nbsp; When
not engaged about the works connected with his collieries, he was
occupied in horticulture and farming.&nbsp; He continued proud of
his flowers, his fruits, and his crops; and the old spirit of
competition was still strong within him.&nbsp; Although he had
for some time been in delicate health, and his hand shook from
nervous affection, he appeared to possess a sound
constitution.&nbsp; Emerson had observed of him that he had the
lives of many men in him.&nbsp; But perhaps the American spoke
figuratively, in reference to his vast stores of
experience.&nbsp; It appeared that he had never completely
recovered from the attack of pleurisy which seized him during his
return from Spain.&nbsp; As late, however, as the 26th July,
1848, he felt himself sufficiently well to be able to attend a
meeting of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers at Birmingham,
and to read to the members his paper &ldquo;On the Fallacies of
the Rotatory Engine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was his last appearance
before them.&nbsp; Shortly after his return to Tapton, he had an
attack of intermittent fever, from which he seemed to be
recovering, when a sudden effusion of blood from the lungs
carried him off, on the 12th August, 1848, in the sixty-seventh
year of his age.&nbsp; When all was over, Robert wrote to Edward
Pease, &ldquo;With deep pain I inform you, as one of his oldest
friends, of the death of my dear father this morning at 12
o&rsquo;clock, after about ten days&rsquo; illness from severe
fever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Starbuck, who was also present, wrote,
&ldquo;The favourable symptoms of yesterday morning were <!--
page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>towards evening followed by a serious change for the
worse.&nbsp; This continued during the night, and early this
morning it became evident that he was sinking.&nbsp; At a few
minutes before 12 to-day he breathed his last.&nbsp; All that the
most devoted and unremitting care of Mrs. Stephenson <a
name="citation354"></a><a href="#footnote354"
class="citation">[354]</a> and the skill of medicine could
accomplish, has been done, but in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Stephenson&rsquo;s remains were followed to the grave
by a large body of his workpeople, by whom he was greatly admired
and beloved.&nbsp; They remembered him as a kind master, who was
ever ready actively to promote all measures for their moral,
physical, and mental improvement.&nbsp; The inhabitants of
Chesterfield evinced their respect for the deceased by suspending
business, closing their shops, and joining in the funeral
procession, which was headed by the corporation of the
town.&nbsp; Many of the surrounding gentry also attended.&nbsp;
The body was interred in Trinity Church, Chesterfield, where a
simple tablet marks the great engineer&rsquo;s last
resting-place.</p>
<p>The statue of George Stephenson, which the Liverpool and
Manchester and Grand Junction Companies had commissioned, was on
its way to England when his death occurred; and it served for a
monument, though his best monument will always be his
works.&nbsp; The statue referred to was placed in St.
George&rsquo;s Hall, Liverpool.&nbsp; A full-length statue of
him, by Bailey, was also erected a few years later, in the noble
vestibule of the London and North-Western Station, in Euston
Square.&nbsp; A subscription for the purpose was set on foot by
the Society of Mechanical Engineers, of which he had been the
founder and president.&nbsp; A few advertisements were inserted
in the newspapers, inviting subscriptions; and it is a notable
fact that the voluntary offerings included an average of two
shillings each from <!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>3150 working men, who embraced this
opportunity of doing honour to their distinguished fellow
workman.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But unquestionably the finest and most appropriate statue to
the memory of George Stephenson is that erected in 1862, after
the design of John Lough, at Newcastle-upon Tyne.&nbsp; It is in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Literary and Philosophical
Institute, to which both George and his son Robert were so much
indebted in their early years; close to the great Stephenson
locomotive foundry established by the shrewdness of the father;
and in the vicinity of the High Level Bridge, one of the grandest
products of the genius of the son.&nbsp; The head of Stephenson,
as expressed in this noble work, is massive, characteristic, and
faithful; and the attitude of the figure is simple yet manly and
energetic.&nbsp; It stands on a pedestal, at the respective
corners of which are sculptured the recumbent figures of a
pitman, a mechanic, an engine-driver, and a plate-layer.&nbsp;
The statue <!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>appropriately stands in a very
thoroughfare of working-men, thousands of whom see it daily as
they pass to and from their work; and we can imagine them, as
they look up to Stephenson&rsquo;s manly figure, applying to it
the words addressed by Robert Nicoll to Robert Burns, with
perhaps still greater appropriateness:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Before the proudest of the earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We stand, with an uplifted brow;<br />
Like us, thou wast a toiling man,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are noble, now!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The portrait prefixed to this volume gives a good indication
of George Stephenson&rsquo;s shrewd, kind, honest, manly
face.&nbsp; His fair, clear countenance was ruddy, and seemingly
glowed with health.&nbsp; The forehead was large and high,
projecting over the eyes, and there was that massive breadth
across the lower part which is usually observed in men of eminent
constructive skill.&nbsp; The mouth was firmly marked, and
shrewdness and humour lurked there as well as in the keen grey
eye.&nbsp; His frame was compact, well-knit, and rather
spare.&nbsp; His hair became grey at an early age, and towards
the close of his life it was of a pure silky whiteness.&nbsp; He
dressed neatly in black, wearing a white neckcloth; and his face,
his person, and his deportment at once arrested attention, and
marked the Gentleman.</p>

Bridge</span>, <span class="smcap">Lower
Canada</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Illness and
Death</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stephenson
Characteristics</span>.</h2>
<p>George Stephenson bequeathed to his son his valuable
collieries, his share in the engine manufactory at Newcastle, and
his large accumulation of savings, which, together with the
fortune he had himself amassed by railway work, gave Robert the
position of an engineer millionaire&mdash;the first of his
order.&nbsp; He continued, however, to live in a quiet style; and
although he bought occasional pictures and statues, and indulged
in the luxury of a yacht, he did not live up to his income, which
went on rapidly accumulating until his death.</p>
<p>There was no longer the necessity for applying himself to the
laborious business of a parliamentary engineer, in which he had
now been occupied for some fifteen years.&nbsp; Shortly after his
father&rsquo;s death, Edward Pease strongly recommended him to
give up the more harassing work of his profession; and his reply
(15th June, 1850) was as <!-- page 358--><a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The suggestion which your kind
note contains is quite in accordance with my own feelings and
intentions respecting retirement; but I find it a very difficult
matter to bring to a close so complicated a connexion in business
as that which has been established by twenty-five years of active
and arduous professional duty.&nbsp; Comparative retirement is,
however, my intention; and I trust that your prayer for the
Divine blessing to grant me happiness and quiet comfort will be
fulfilled.&nbsp; I cannot but feel deeply grateful to the Great
Disposer of events for the success which has hitherto attended my
exertions in life; and I trust that the future will also be
marked by a continuance of His mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Robert Stephenson, in conformity with this expressed
intention, for the most part declined to undertake new business,
he did not altogether lay aside his harness; and he lived to
repeat his tubular bridges both in Lower Canada and in
Egypt.&nbsp; The success of the tubular system, as adopted at
Menai and Conway, was such as to recommend it for adoption
wherever great span was required; and the peculiar circumstances
connected with the navigation of the St. Lawrence and the Nile,
may be said to have compelled its adoption in carrying railways
across those great rivers.</p>
<p>The Victoria Bridge, of which Robert Stephenson was the
designer and chief engineer, is, without exception, the greatest
work of the kind in the world.&nbsp; For gigantic proportions and
vast length and strength there is nothing to compare with it in
ancient or modern times.&nbsp; The entire bridge, with its
approaches, is only about sixty yards short of <i>two miles</i>,
being five times longer than the Britannia across the Menai
Straits, seven and a half times longer than Waterloo Bridge, and
more than ten times longer than the new Chelsea Bridge across the
Thames!&nbsp; It has not less than twenty-four spans of 242 feet
each, and one great central span&mdash;itself an immense
bridge&mdash;of 330 feet.&nbsp; The road is carried within iron
tubes 60 feet above the level of <!-- page 359--><a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>the St.
Lawrence, which runs beneath at a speed of about ten miles an
hour, and in winter brings down the ice of two thousand square
miles of lakes and rivers, with their numerous tributaries.&nbsp;
The weight of iron in the tubes is about ten thousand tons,
supported on massive piers, which contain, some six, and others
ten thousand tons of solid masonry.</p>
<p>So gigantic a work, involving so heavy an
expenditure&mdash;about &pound;1,300,000&mdash;was not projected
without sufficient cause.&nbsp; The Grand Trunk Railway of
Canada, upwards of 1200 miles in length, traverses British North
America from the shores of the Atlantic to the rich prairie
country of the Far West.&nbsp; It opens up a vast extent of
fertile territory for future immigration, and provides a ready
means for transporting the varied products of the Western States
to the seaboard.&nbsp; So long as the St. Lawrence was relied
upon, the inhabitants along the Great Valley were precluded from
communication with each other for nearly six months of the year,
during which the navigation was closed by the ice.</p>
<p>The Grand Trunk Railway was designed to furnish a line of
communication through this great district at all seasons;
following the course of the St. Lawrence along its north bank,
and uniting the principal towns of Canada.&nbsp; But stopping
short on the north shore, it was still an incomplete work;
unconnected, except by a dangerous and often impracticable ferry,
with Montreal, the capital of the province, and shut off from
connection with the United States, as well as with the coast to
which the commerce of Canada naturally tends.&nbsp; Without a
bridge at Montreal, therefore, it was felt that the system of
Canadian railway communication would have been incomplete, and
the benefits of the Grand Trunk Railway in a great measure
nugatory.</p>
<p>As early as 1846 the construction of a bridge across the St.
Lawrence at Montreal was strongly advocated by the local press
for the purpose of directly connecting that city with the then
projected Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railway.&nbsp; A survey of
the bridge was made, and the <!-- page 360--><a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>scheme was
reported to be practicable.&nbsp; A period of colonial
depression, however, intervened, and although the project was not
lost sight of, it was not until 1852, when the Grand Trunk
Railway Company began their operations, that there seemed to be
any reasonable prospect of its being carried out.&nbsp; In that
year, Mr. A. M. Ross&mdash;who had superintended, under Robert
Stephenson, the construction of the tubular bridge over the
Conway&mdash;visited Canada, and inspected the site of the
proposed bridge, when he readily arrived at the conclusion that a
like structure was suitable for the crossing of the St.
Lawrence.&nbsp; He returned to England to confer with Robert
Stephenson on the subject, and the result was the plan of the
Victoria Bridge, of which Robert Stephenson was the designer, and
Mr. A. M. Ross the joint and resident engineer.</p>
<p>The particular kind of structure to be adopted, however,
formed the subject of much preliminary discussion.&nbsp; Even
after the design of a tubular bridge had been adopted, and the
piers were commenced, the plan was made the subject of severe
criticism, on the ground of its alleged excessive cost.&nbsp; It
therefore became necessary for Mr. Stephenson to vindicate the
propriety of his design in a report to the directors of the
railway, in which he satisfactorily proved that as respected
strength, efficiency, and economy, with a view to permanency, the
plan of the Victoria Bridge was unimpeachable.&nbsp; There were
various methods proposed for spanning the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The
suspension bridge, such as that over the river Niagara, was found
inapplicable for several reasons, but chiefly because of its
defective rigidity, which greatly limited the speed and weight of
the trains, and consequently the amount of traffic which could be
passed over such a bridge.&nbsp; Thus, taking the length of the
Victoria Bridge into account, it was found that not more than 20
trains could pass within the 24 hours, a number insufficient for
the accommodation of the anticipated traffic.&nbsp; To introduce
such an amount of material into the suspension bridge as would
supply increased <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>rigidity, would only be
approximating to the original beam, and neutralizing any
advantages in point of cheapness which might be derivable from
this form of structure, without securing the essential stiffness
and strength.&nbsp; Iron arches were also considered
inapplicable, because of the large headway required for the
passage of the ice in winter, and the necessity which existed for
keeping the springing of the arches clear of the
water-line.&nbsp; This would have involved the raising of the
entire road, and a largely increased expenditure on the upper
works.&nbsp; The question was therefore reduced to the
consideration of the kind of <i>horizontal beam</i> or
<i>girder</i> to be employed.</p>
<p>Horizontal girders are of three kinds.&nbsp; The
<i>Tubular</i> is constructed of riveted rectangular boiler
plates.&nbsp; Where the span is large, the road passes within the
tube; where the span is comparatively small, the roadway is
supported by two or more rectangular beams.&nbsp; Next there is
the <i>Lattice</i> girder, borrowed from the loose rough timber
bridges of the American engineers, consisting of a top and bottom
flange connected by a number of flat iron bars, riveted across
each other at a certain angle, the roadway resting on the top, or
being suspended at the bottom between the lattice on either
side.&nbsp; Bridges on the same construction are now extensively
used for crossing the broad rivers of India, and are especially
designed with a view to their easy transport and erection.&nbsp;
The <i>Trellis</i> or Warren girder is a modification of the same
plan, consisting of a top and bottom flange, with a connecting
web of diagonal flat bars, forming a complete system of
triangulation&mdash;hence the name of &ldquo;Triangular
girder,&rdquo; by which it is generally known.&nbsp; The merit of
this form consists in its comparative rigidity, strength,
lightness, and economy of material These bridges are also
extensively employed in spanning the rivers of India.&nbsp; One
of the best specimens is the Crumlin viaduct, 200 feet high at
one point, which spans the river and valley of the Ebbw near the
village of Crumlin in South Wales.&nbsp; This viaduct is about a
third of a mile <!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>long, divided into two parts by a
ridge of hills which runs through the centre of the
valley&mdash;each part forming a separate viaduct, the one of
seven equal spans of 150 feet, the other of three spans of the
same diameter.&nbsp; The bridge has been very skilfully designed
and constructed, and, by reason of its great dimensions and novel
arrangements, is entitled to be regarded as one of the most
remarkable engineering works of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In calculating the strength of these different classes
of girders,&rdquo; Mr. Stephenson observed, &ldquo;one ruling
principle appertains, and is common to all of them.&nbsp;
Primarily and essentially, the ultimate strength is considered to
exist in the top and bottom,&mdash;the former being exposed to a
compression force by the action of the load, and the latter to a
force of tension; therefore, whatever be the class or
denomination of girders, they must all be alike in amount of
effective material in these members, if their spans and depths
are the same, and they have to sustain the same amount of
load.&nbsp; Hence, the question of comparative merit amongst the
different classes of construction of beams or girders is really
narrowed to the method of connecting the top and bottom
<i>webs</i>, so called.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the tubular system the
connexion is effected by continuous boiler plates riveted
together; and in the lattice and trellis bridges by flat iron
bars, more or less numerous, forming a series of struts and
ties.&nbsp; Those engineers who advocate the employment of the
latter form of construction, set forth as its principal advantage
the saving of material which is effected by employing bars
instead of iron plates; whereas Mr. Stephenson and his followers
urge, that in point of economy the boiler plate side is equal to
the bars, whilst in point of effective strength and rigidity it
is decidedly superior.&nbsp; To show the comparative economy of
material, he contrasted the lattice girder bridge over the river
Trent, on the Great Northern Railway near Newark, with the tubes
of the Victoria Bridge.&nbsp; In the former case, where the span
is 240&frac12; feet, and the bridge 13 feet wide, the weight
including bearings is 292 tons; <!-- page 363--><a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>in the
latter, where the span is 242 feet, the width of the tube 16
feet, the weight including bearings is 275 tons, showing a
balance in favour of the Victoria Tube of 17 tons.&nbsp; The
comparison between the Newark Dyke Bridge and the Tubular Bridge
over the river Aire is equally favourable to the latter; and no
one can have travelled over the Great Northern line to York
without noting that, as respects rigidity under the passing
train, the Tubular Bridge is decidedly superior.&nbsp; It is
ascertained that the deflection caused by a passing load is
considerably greater in the former case; and Mr. Stephenson was
also of opinion that the sides of all trellis or lattice girders
are useless, except for the purpose of connecting the top and
bottom, and keeping them in their position.&nbsp; They depend
upon their connexion with the top and bottom webs for their own
support; and since they could not sustain their shape, but would
collapse immediately on their being disconnected from their top
and bottom members, it is evident that they add to the strain
upon them, and consequently to that extent reduce the ultimate
strength of the beams.&nbsp; &ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that there is no formula for valuing the <i>solid</i>
sides for strains, and that at present we only ascribe to them
the value or use of connecting the top and bottom; yet we are
aware that, from their continuity and solidity, they are of value
to resist horizontal and many other strains, independently of the
top and bottom, by which they add very much to the stiffness of
the beam; and the fact of their containing more material than is
necessary to connect the top and bottom webs, has by no means
been fairly established.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another important advantage
of the Tubular bridge over the Trellis or Lattice structure,
consists in its greater safety in event of a train running off
the line,&mdash;a contingency which has more than once occurred
on a tubular bridge without detriment, whereas in event of such
an accident occurring on a Trellis or Lattice bridge, it must
infallibly be destroyed.&nbsp; Where the proposed bridge is of
the unusual length of a mile and a quarter, it is obvious <!--
page 364--><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>that this consideration must have had no small weight
with the directors, who eventually decided on proceeding with the
Tubular Bridge according to Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s original
design.</p>
<p>From the first projection of the Victoria Bridge, the
difficulties of executing such a work across a wide river, down
which an avalanche of ice rushes to the sea every spring, were
pronounced almost insurmountable by those best acquainted with
the locality.&nbsp; The ice of two thousand miles of inland lakes
and upper rivers, besides their tributaries, is then poured down
stream, and, in the neighbourhood of Montreal especially, it is
often piled up to the height of from forty to fifty feet, placing
the surrounding country under water, and doing severe damage to
the massive stone buildings along the noble river front of the
city.&nbsp; To resist so prodigious a pressure, it was necessary
that the piers of the proposed bridge should be of the most solid
and massive description.&nbsp; Their foundations are placed in
the solid rock; for none of the artificial methods of obtaining
foundations, suggested by some engineers for cheapness&rsquo;
sake, were found practicable in this case.&nbsp; Where the force
exercised against the piers was likely to be so great, it was
felt that timber ice-breakers, timber or cast-iron piling, or
even rubble-work, would have proved but temporary
expedients.&nbsp; The two centre piers are eighteen feet wide,
and the remaining twenty-two piers fifteen feet; to arrest and
break the ice, an inclined plane, composed of great blocks of
stone, was added to the up-river side of each pier&mdash;each
block weighing from seven to ten tons, and the whole were firmly
clamped together with iron rivets.</p>
<p>To convey some idea of the immense force which these piers are
required to resist, we may briefly describe the breaking up of
the ice in March, 1858, while the bridge was under
construction.&nbsp; Fourteen out of the twenty-four piers were
then finished, together with the formidable abutments and
approaches to the bridge.&nbsp; The ice in the <!-- page 365--><a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>river began
to show signs of weakness on the 29th March, but it was not until
the 31st that a general movement became observable, which
continued for an hour, when it suddenly stopped, and the water
rose rapidly.&nbsp; On the following day, at noon, a grand
movement commenced; the waters rose about four feet in two
minutes, up to a level with many of the Montreal streets.&nbsp;
The fields of ice at the same time were suddenly elevated to an
incredible height; and so overwhelming were they in appearance,
that crowds of the townspeople, who had assembled on the quay to
watch the progress of the flood, ran for their lives.&nbsp; This
movement lasted about twenty minutes, during which the jammed ice
destroyed several portions of the quay-wall, grinding the hardest
blocks to atoms.&nbsp; The embanked approaches to the Victoria
Bridge had tremendous forces to resist.&nbsp; In the full channel
of the stream, the ice in its passage between the piers was
broken up by the force of the blow immediately on its coming in
contact with the cutwaters.&nbsp; Sometimes thick sheets of ice
were seen to rise up and rear on end against the piers, but by
the force of the current they were speedily made to roll over
into the stream, and in a moment after were out of sight.&nbsp;
For the two next days the river was still high, until on the 4th
April the waters seemed suddenly to give way, and by the
following day the river was flowing clear and smooth as a
millpond, nothing of winter remaining except the masses of
bordage ice which were strewn along the shores of the
stream.&nbsp; On examination of the piers of the bridge, it was
found that they had admirably resisted the tremendous pressure;
and though the timber &ldquo;cribwork&rdquo; erected to
facilitate the placing of floating pontoons to form the dams, was
found considerably disturbed and in some places seriously
damaged, the piers, with the exception of one or two heavy stone
blocks, which were still unfinished, escaped uninjured.&nbsp; One
heavy block of many tons&rsquo; weight was carried to a
considerable distance, and must have been torn out of its <!--
page 366--><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>place by sheer force, as several of the broken
fragments were found left in the pier.</p>
<p>The works in connection with the Victoria Bridge were begun on
the 22nd July, 1854, when the first stone was laid, and continued
uninterruptedly during a period of 5&frac12; years, until the
17th December, 1859, when the bridge was finished and taken off
the contractor&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was formally opened for
traffic early in 1860; though Robert Stephenson did not live to
see its completion.</p>
<p>The tubular system was also applied by the same engineer, in a
modified form, in the two bridges across the Nile, near Damietta
in Lower Egypt.&nbsp; That near Benha contains eight spans or
openings of 80 feet each, and two centre spans, formed by one of
the largest swing bridges ever constructed,&mdash;the total
length of the swing-beam being 157 feet,&mdash;a clear water-way
of 60 feet being provided on either side of the centre
pier.&nbsp; The only novelty in these bridges consisted in the
road being carried <i>upon</i> the tubes instead of within them;
their erection being carried out in the usual manner, by means of
workmen, materials, and plant sent out from England.</p>
<p>During the later years of his life, Mr. Stephenson took
considerable interest in public affairs and in scientific
investigations.&nbsp; In 1847 he entered the House of Commons as
member for Whitby; but he does not seem to have been very devoted
in his attendance, and only appeared on divisions when there was
a &ldquo;whip&rdquo; of the party to which he belonged.&nbsp; He
was a member of the Sanitary and Sewage Commissions, and of the
Commission which sat on Westminster Bridge.&nbsp; The last
occasions on which he addressed the House were on the Suez Canal
and the cleansing of the Serpentine.&nbsp; He pronounced the Suez
Canal to be an impracticable scheme.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have surveyed
the line,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have travelled the whole
distance on foot, and I declare there is no fall between the two
seas.&nbsp; Honourable members talk about a canal.&nbsp; A canal
is impossible&mdash;the thing would only be a ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>Besides constructing the railway between Alexandria and
Cairo, he was consulted, like his father, by the King of Belgium,
as to the railways of that country; and he was made Knight of the
Order of Leopold because of the improvements which he had made in
locomotive engines, so much to the advantage of the Belgian
system of inland transit.&nbsp; He was consulted by the King of
Sweden as to the railway between Christiana and Lake Mi&ouml;sen,
and in consideration of his services was decorated with the Grand
Cross of the Order of St. Olaf.&nbsp; He also visited
Switzerland, Piedmont, and Denmark, to advise as to the system of
railway communication best suited for those countries.&nbsp; At
the Paris Exhibition of 1855 the Emperor of France decorated him
with the Legion of Honour in consideration of his public
services; and at home the University of Oxford made him a Doctor
of Civil Laws.&nbsp; In 1855 he was elected President of the
Institute of Civil Engineers, which office he held with honour
and filled with distinguished ability for two years, giving place
to his friend Mr. Locke at the end of 1857.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson was frequently called upon to act as arbitrator
between contractors and railway companies, or between one company
and another,&mdash;great value being attached to his opinion on
account of his weighty judgment, his great experience, and his
upright character, and we believe his decisions were invariably
stamped by the qualities of impartiality and justice.&nbsp; He
was always ready to lend a helping hand to a friend, and no petty
jealousy stood between him and his rivals in the engineering
world.&nbsp; The author remembers being with Mr. Stephenson one
evening at his house in Gloucester Square, when a note was put
into his hands from his friend Brunel, then engaged in his first
fruitless efforts to launch the <i>Great Eastern</i>.&nbsp; It
was to ask Stephenson to come down to Blackwall early next
morning, and give him the benefit of his judgment.&nbsp; Shortly
after six next morning Stephenson was in Scott Russell&rsquo;s
building-yard, and he <!-- page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 368</span>remained there until dusk.&nbsp;
About midday, while superintending the launching operations, the
baulk of timber on which he stood canted up, and he fell up to
his middle in the Thames mud.&nbsp; He was dressed as usual,
without great-coat (though the day was bitter cold), and with
only thin boots upon his feet.&nbsp; He was urged to leave the
yard, and change his dress, or at least dry himself; but with his
usual disregard of health, he replied, &ldquo;Oh, never mind
me&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite used to this sort of thing;&rdquo; and
he went paddling about in the mud, smoking his cigar, until
almost dark, when the day&rsquo;s work was brought to an
end.&nbsp; The result of this exposure was an attack of
inflammation of the lungs, which kept him to his bed for a
fortnight.</p>
<p>He was habitually careless of his health, and perhaps he
indulged in narcotics to a prejudicial extent.&nbsp; Hence he
often became &ldquo;hipped&rdquo; and sometimes ill.&nbsp; When
Mr. Sopwith accompanied him to Egypt in the <i>Titania</i>, in
1856, he succeeded in persuading Mr. Stephenson to limit his
indulgence in cigars and stimulants, and the consequence was that
by the end of the voyage he felt himself, as he said,
&ldquo;quite a new man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Arrived at Marseilles, he
telegraphed from thence a message to Great George Street,
prescribing certain stringent and salutary rules for observance
in the office there on his return.&nbsp; But he was of a facile,
social disposition, and the old associations proved too strong
for him.&nbsp; When he sailed for Norway, in the autumn of 1859,
though then ailing in health, he looked a man who had still
plenty of life in him.&nbsp; By the time he returned, his fatal
illness had seized him.&nbsp; He was attacked by congestion of
the liver, which first developed itself in jaundice, and then ran
into dropsy, of which he died on the 12th October, in the
fifty-sixth year of his age. <a name="citation368"></a><a
href="#footnote368" class="citation">[368]</a>&nbsp; He was
buried by the side of Telford in <!-- page 369--><a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>Westminster
Abbey, amidst the departed great men of his country, and was
attended to his resting-place by many of the intimate friends of
his boyhood and his manhood.&nbsp; Among those who assembled
round his grave were some of the greatest men of thought and
action in England, who embraced the sad occasion to pay the last
mark of their respect to this illustrious son of one of
England&rsquo;s greatest working men.</p>

370</span>It would be out of keeping with the subject thus drawn
to a conclusion, to pronounce any panegyric on the character and
achievements of George and Robert Stephenson.&nbsp; These for the
most part speak for themselves.&nbsp; Both were emphatically true
men, exhibiting in their lives many sterling qualities.&nbsp; No
beginning could have been less promising than that of the elder
Stephenson.&nbsp; Born in a poor condition, yet rich in spirit,
he was from the first compelled to rely upon himself; and every
step of advance which he made was conquered by patient
labour.&nbsp; Whether working as a brakesman or an engineer, his
mind was always full of the work in hand.&nbsp; He gave himself
thoroughly up to it.&nbsp; Like the painter, he might say that he
had become great &ldquo;by neglecting nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whatever he was engaged upon, he was as careful of the details as
if each were itself the whole.&nbsp; He did all thoroughly and
honestly.&nbsp; There was no &ldquo;scamping&rdquo; with
him.&nbsp; When a workman he put his brains and labour into his
work; and when a master he put his conscience and character into
it.&nbsp; He would have no slop-work executed merely for the sake
of profit.&nbsp; The materials must be as genuine as the
workmanship was skilful.&nbsp; The structures which he designed
and executed were distinguished for their thoroughness and
solidity; his locomotives were famous for their durability and
excellent working qualities.&nbsp; The engines which he sent to
the United States in 1832 are still in good condition; and even
the engines built by him for the Killingworth Colliery, upwards
of thirty years ago, are working steadily there to this
day.&nbsp; All his work was honest, representing the actual
character of the man.</p>
<p>He was ready to turn his hand to anything&mdash;shoes and
clocks, railways and locomotives.&nbsp; He contrived his
safety-lamp with the object of saving pitmen&rsquo;s lives, and
perilled his own life in testing it.&nbsp; Whatever work was
nearest him, he turned to and did it.&nbsp; With him to resolve
was to do.&nbsp; Many men knew far more than he; but none were
more <!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>ready forthwith to apply what he did
know to practical purposes.&nbsp; It was while working at
Willington as a brakes-man, that he first learnt how best to
handle a spade in throwing ballast out of the ships&rsquo;
holds.&nbsp; This casual employment seems to have left upon his
mind the strongest impression of what &ldquo;hard work&rdquo;
was; and he often used to revert to it, and say to the young men
about him, &ldquo;Ah, ye lads! there&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; ye
know what <i>wark</i> is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gooch says he was
proud of the dexterity in handling a spade which he had thus
acquired, and that he has frequently seen him take the shovel
from a labourer in some railway cutting, and show him how to use
it more deftly in filling waggons of earth, gravel, or
sand.&nbsp; Sir Joshua Walmsley has also informed us, that, when
examining the works of the Orleans and Tours Railway, Mr.
Stephenson, seeing a large number of excavators filling and
wheeling sand in a cutting, at a great waste of time and labour,
went up to the men and said he would show them how to fill their
barrows in half the time.&nbsp; He showed them the proper
position in which to stand so as to exercise the greatest amount
of power with the least expenditure of strength; and he filled
the barrow with comparative ease again and again in their
presence, to the great delight of the workmen.&nbsp; When passing
through his own workshops, he would point out to his men how to
save labour, and to get through their work skilfully and with
ease.&nbsp; His energy imparted itself to others, quickening and
influencing them as strong characters always do&mdash;flowing
down into theirs, and bringing out their best powers.</p>
<p>His deportment towards the workmen employed under him was
familiar, yet firm and consistent.&nbsp; As he respected their
manhood, so did they respect his masterhood.&nbsp; Although he
comported himself towards his men as if they occupied very much
the same level as himself, he yet possessed that peculiar
capacity for governing which enabled him always to preserve among
them the strictest discipline, and to secure their cheerful and
hearty services.&nbsp; <!-- page 372--><a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>Mr. Ingham,
M.P. for South Shields, on going over the workshops at Newcastle,
was particularly struck with this quality of the master in his
bearing towards his men.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was nothing,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;of undue familiarity in their intercourse, but
they spoke to each other as man to man; and nothing seemed to
please the master more than to point out illustrations of the
ingenuity of his artisans.&nbsp; He took up a rivet, and
expatiated on the skill with which it had been fashioned by the
workman&rsquo;s hand&mdash;its perfectness and truth.&nbsp; He
was always proud of his workmen and his pupils; and, while
indifferent and careless as to what might be said of himself, he
fired up in a moment if disparagement were thrown upon any one
whom he had taught or trained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In manner, George Stephenson was simple, modest, and
unassuming, but always manly.&nbsp; He was frank and social in
spirit.&nbsp; When a humble workman, he had carefully preserved
his sense of self-respect.&nbsp; His companions looked up to him,
and his example was worth even more to many of them than books or
schools.&nbsp; His devoted love of knowledge made his poverty
respectable, and adorned his humble calling.&nbsp; When he rose
to a more elevated station, and associated with men of the
highest position and influence in Britain, he took his place
amongst them with perfect self-possession.&nbsp; They wondered at
the quiet ease and simple dignity of his deportment; and men in
the best ranks of life have said of him that &ldquo;He was one of
Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably no military chiefs were ever more beloved by their
soldiers than were both father and son by the army of men who,
under their guidance, worked at labours of profit, made labours
of love by their earnest will and purpose.&nbsp; True leaders of
men and lords of industry, they were always ready to recognise
and encourage talent in those who worked for and with them.&nbsp;
Thus it was pleasant, at the openings of the Stephenson lines, to
hear the chief engineers attributing the successful completion of
the works to their able <!-- page 373--><a
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>assistants;
whilst the assistants, on the other hand, ascribed the glory to
their chiefs.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson, though a thrifty and frugal man, was
essentially unsordid.&nbsp; His rugged path in early life made
him careful of his resources.&nbsp; He never saved to hoard, but
saved for a purpose, such as the maintenance of his parents or
the education of his son.&nbsp; In later years he became a
prosperous and even a wealthy man; but riches never closed his
heart, nor stole away the elasticity of his soul.&nbsp; He
enjoyed life cheerfully, because hopefully.&nbsp; When he entered
upon a commercial enterprise, whether for others or for himself,
he looked carefully at the ways and means.&nbsp; Unless they
would &ldquo;pay,&rdquo; he held back.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would have
nothing to do,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;with stock-jobbing
speculations.&rdquo;&nbsp; His refusal to sell his name to the
schemes of the railway mania&mdash;his survey of the Spanish
lines without remuneration&mdash;his offer to postpone his claim
for payment from a poor company until their affairs became more
prosperous&mdash;are instances of the unsordid spirit in which he
acted.</p>
<p>Another marked feature in Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s character was
his patience.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the strength of his
convictions as to the great uses to which the locomotive might be
applied, he waited long and patiently for the opportunity of
bringing it into notice; and for years after he had completed an
efficient engine he went on quietly devoting himself to the
ordinary work of the colliery.&nbsp; He made no noise nor stir
about his locomotive, but allowed another to take credit for the
experiments on velocity and friction made with it by himself upon
the Killingworth railroad.</p>
<p>By patient industry and laborious contrivance, he was enabled,
with the powerful help of his son, to do for the locomotive what
James Watt had done for the condensing engine.&nbsp; He found it
clumsy and inefficient; and he made it powerful, efficient, and
useful.&nbsp; Both have been described as the improvers of their
respective engines; but, as to all that is admirable in their
structure or vast in their utility, they are rather entitled to
be described as their Inventors.&nbsp; <!-- page 374--><a
name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>While the
invention of Watt increased the power, and at the same time so
regulated the action of the steam-engine, as to make it capable
of being applied alike to the hardest work and to the finest
manufactures, the invention of Stephenson gave an effective power
to the locomotive, which enabled it to perform the work of teams
of the most powerful horses, and to outstrip the speed of the
fleetest.&nbsp; Watt&rsquo;s invention exercised a wonderfully
quickening influence on every branch of industry, and multiplied
a thousand-fold the amount of manufactured productions; and
Stephenson&rsquo;s enabled these to be distributed with an
economy and despatch such as had never before been thought
possible.&nbsp; They have both tended to increase indefinitely
the mass of human comforts and enjoyments, and to render them
cheap and accessible to all.&nbsp; But Stephenson&rsquo;s
invention, by the influence which it is daily exercising upon the
civilisation of the world, is even more remarkable than that of
Watt, and is calculated to have still more important
consequences.&nbsp; In this respect, it is to be regarded as the
grandest application of steam power that has yet been
discovered.</p>
<p>The Locomotive, like the condensing engine, exhibits the
realisation of various capital, but wholly distinct, ideas,
promulgated by many ingenious inventors.&nbsp; Stephenson, like
Watt, exhibited a power of selection, combination, and invention
of his own, by which&mdash;while availing himself of all that had
been done before him, and superadding the many skilful
contrivances devised by himself&mdash;he was at length enabled to
bring his engine into a condition of marvellous power and
efficiency.&nbsp; He gathered together the scattered threads of
ingenuity which already existed, and combined them into one firm
and complete fabric of his own.&nbsp; He realised the plans which
others had imperfectly formed; and was the first to construct,
what so many others had unsuccessfully attempted, the practical
and economical working locomotive.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s close and accurate observation provided
him with a fulness of information on many subjects, which <!--
page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>often appeared surprising to those who had devoted to
them a special study.&nbsp; On one occasion the accuracy of his
knowledge of birds came out in a curious way at a convivial
meeting of railway men in London.&nbsp; The engineers and railway
directors present knew each other as railway men and nothing
more.&nbsp; The talk had been all of railways and railway
politics.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson was a great talker on those
subjects, and was generally allowed, from the interest of his
conversation and the extent of his experience, to take the
lead.&nbsp; At length one of the party broke in with &ldquo;Come
now, Stephenson, we have had nothing but railways; cannot we have
a change and try if we can talk a little about something
else?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Stephenson,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a wide range of subjects; what shall
it be about?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say <i>birds&rsquo;
nests</i>!&rdquo; rejoined the other, who prided himself on his
special knowledge of this subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then birds&rsquo;
nests be it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A long and animated conversation
ensued: the bird-nesting of his boyhood, the blackbird&rsquo;s
nest which his father had held him up in his arms to look at when
a child at Wylam, the hedges in which he had found the
thrush&rsquo;s and the linnet&rsquo;s nests, the mossy bank where
the robin built, the cleft in the branch of the young tree where
the chaffinch had reared its dwelling&mdash;all rose up clear in
his mind&rsquo;s eye, and led him back to the scenes of his
boyhood at Callerton and Dewley Burn.&nbsp; The colour and number
of the bird&rsquo;s eggs, the period of their incubation, the
materials employed by them for the walls and lining of their
nests, were described by him so vividly, and illustrated by such
graphic anecdotes, that one of the party remarked that, if George
Stephenson had not been the greatest engineer of his day, he
might have been one of the greatest naturalists.</p>
<p>His powers of conversation were very great.&nbsp; He was so
thoughtful, so original, and so suggestive.&nbsp; There was
scarcely a department of science on which he had not formed some
novel and sometimes daring theory.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Gooch, his
pupil, who lived with him when at <!-- page 376--><a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>Liverpool,
informs us that when sitting over the fire, he would frequently
broach his favourite theory of the sun&rsquo;s light and heat
being the original source of the light and heat given forth by
the burning coal.&nbsp; &ldquo;It fed the plants of which that
coal is made,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;and has been bottled up
in the earth ever since, to be given out again now for the use of
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; His son Robert once said of him, &ldquo;My
father flashed his bull&rsquo;s eye full upon a subject, and
brought it out in its most vivid light in an instant: his strong
common sense, and his varied experience operating upon a
thoughtful mind, were his most powerful illuminators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephenson had once a conversation with a watchmaker, whom
he astonished by the extent and minuteness of his knowledge as to
the parts of a watch.&nbsp; The watchmaker knew him to be an
eminent engineer, and asked him how he had acquired so extensive
a knowledge of a branch of business so much out of his
sphere.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very easy to be explained,&rdquo; said
Mr. Stephenson; &ldquo;I worked long at watch-cleaning myself,
and when I was at a loss, I was never ashamed to ask for
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the close of his life he frequently went down to
Newcastle, and visited the scenes of his boyhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been to Callerton,&rdquo; said he one day to a friend,
&ldquo;and seen the fields in which I used to pull turnips at
twopence a day; and many a cold finger, I can tell you, I
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand was open to his former fellow-workmen whom old age
had left in poverty.&nbsp; To poor Robert Gray, of Newburn, who
acted as his bridesman on his marriage to Fanny Henderson, he
left a pension for life.&nbsp; He would slip a five-pound note
into the hand of a poor man or a widow in such a way as not to
offend their delicacy, but to make them feel as if the obligation
were all on his side.&nbsp; When Farmer Paterson, who married a
sister of George&rsquo;s first wife, Fanny Henderson, died and
left a large young family fatherless, poverty stared them in the
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;But ye ken,&rdquo; said our informant,
&ldquo;<i>George struck in fayther for them</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>And perhaps the providential character of the act could
not have been more graphically expressed than in these simple
words.</p>
<p>On his visit to Newcastle, he would frequently meet the
friends of his early days, occupying very nearly the same
station, whilst he had meanwhile risen to almost world-wide
fame.&nbsp; But he was no less hearty in his greeting of them
than if their relative position had continued the same.&nbsp;
Thus, one day, after shaking hands with Mr. Brandling on
alighting from his carriage, he proceeded to shake hands with his
coachman, Anthony Wigham, a still older friend, though he only
sat on the box.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson inherited his father&rsquo;s kindly spirit
and benevolent disposition.&nbsp; He almost worshipped his
father&rsquo;s memory, and was ever ready to attribute to him the
chief merit of his own achievements as an engineer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was his thorough training,&rdquo; we once heard him
say, &ldquo;his example, and his character, which made me the man
I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; On a more public occasion he said, &ldquo;It
is my great pride to remember, that whatever may have been done,
and however extensive may have been my own connection with
railway development, all I know and all I have done is primarily
due to the parent whose memory I cherish and revere.&rdquo; <a
name="citation377"></a><a href="#footnote377"
class="citation">[377]</a>&nbsp; To Mr. Lough, the sculptor, he
said he had never had but two loves&mdash;one for his father, the
other for his wife.</p>
<p>Like his father, he was eminently practical, and yet always
open to the influence and guidance of correct theory.&nbsp; His
main consideration in laying out his lines of railway was what
would best answer the intended purpose, or, to use his own words,
to secure the maximum of result with the minimum of means.&nbsp;
He was pre-eminently a safe man, because cautious, tentative, and
experimental; following closely the lines of conduct trodden by
his father, and often quoting his maxims.</p>
<p><!-- page 378--><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>In society Robert Stephenson was simple, unobtrusive,
and modest; but charming and even fascinating in an eminent
degree.&nbsp; Sir John Lawrence has said of him that he was, of
all others, the man he most delighted to meet in England&mdash;he
was so manly, yet gentle, and withal so great.&nbsp; While
admired and beloved by men of such calibre, he was equally a
favourite with women and children.&nbsp; He put himself upon the
level of all, and charmed them no less by his inexpressible
kindliness of manner than by his simple yet impressive
conversation.</p>
<p>His great wealth enabled him to perform many generous acts in
a right noble and yet modest manner, not letting his right hand
know what his left hand did.&nbsp; Of the numerous kindly acts of
his which have been made public, we may mention the graceful
manner in which he repaid the obligations which both himself and
his father owed to the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical
Institute, when working together as humble experimenters in their
cottage at Killingworth.&nbsp; The Institute was struggling under
a debt of &pound;6200 which seriously impaired its usefulness as
an educational agency.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson offered to pay
one-half of the sum, provided the local supporters of the
Institute would raise the remainder; and conditional also on the
annual subscription being reduced from two guineas to one, in
order that the usefulness of the institution might be
extended.&nbsp; The generous offer was accepted, and the debt
extinguished.</p>
<p>Both father and son were offered knighthood, and both declined
it.&nbsp; During the summer of 1847, George Stephenson was
invited to offer himself as a candidate for the representation of
South Shields in Parliament.&nbsp; But his politics were at best
of a very undefined sort; indeed his life had been so much
occupied with subjects of a practical character, that he had
scarcely troubled himself to form any decided opinion on the
party political topics of the day, and to stand the cross fire of
the electors on the hustings might have been found an even more
distressing ordeal <!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>than the cross-questioning of the
barristers in the Committees of the House of Commons.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Politics,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;are all matters of
theory&mdash;there is no stability in them: they shift about like
the sands of the sea: and I should feel quite out of my element
amongst them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had accordingly the good sense
respectfully to decline the honour of contesting the
representation of South Shields.</p>
<p>We have, however, been informed by Sir Joseph Paxton, that
although George Stephenson held no strong opinions on political
questions generally, there was one question on which he
entertained a decided conviction, and that was the question of
Free-trade.&nbsp; The words used by him on one occasion to Sir
Joseph were very strong.&nbsp; &ldquo;England,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is, and must be a shopkeeper; and our docks and harbours
are only so many wholesale shops, the doors of which should
always be kept wide open.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is curious that his son
Robert should have taken precisely the opposite view of this
question, and acted throughout with the most rigid party amongst
the protectionists, supporting the Navigation Laws and opposing
Free Trade.</p>
<p>But Robert Stephenson will be judged in after times by his
achievements as an engineer, rather than by his acts as a
politician; and happily these last were far outweighed in value
by the immense practical services which he rendered to trade,
commerce, and civilisation, through the facilities which the
railways constructed by him afforded for free intercommunication
between men in all parts of the world.&nbsp; Speaking in the
midst of his friends at Newcastle, in 1850, he
observed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me but as yesterday that I was engaged as
an assistant in laying out the Stockton and Darlington
Railway.&nbsp; Since then, the Liverpool and Manchester and a
hundred other great works have sprung into existence.&nbsp; As I
look back upon these stupendous undertakings, accomplished in so
short a time, it seems as though we had realised in our
generation the fabled powers of the magician&rsquo;s wand.&nbsp;
Hills have been cut down and valleys filled <!-- page 380--><a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>up; and
when these simple expedients have not sufficed, high and
magnificent viaducts have been raised, and if mountains stood in
the way, tunnels of unexampled magnitude have pierced them
through, bearing their triumphant attestation to the indomitable
energy of the nation, and the unrivalled skill of our
artisans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As respects the immense advantages of railways to mankind,
there cannot be two opinions.&nbsp; They exhibit, probably, the
grandest organisation of capital and labour that the world has
yet seen.&nbsp; Although they have unhappily occasioned great
loss to many, the loss has been that of individuals; whilst, as a
national system, the gain has already been enormous.&nbsp; As
tending to multiply and spread abroad the conveniences of life,
opening up new fields of industry, bringing nations nearer to
each other, and thus promoting the great ends of civilisation,
the founding of the railway system by George Stephenson and his
son must be regarded as one of the most important events, if not
the very greatest, in the first half of this nineteenth
century.</p>

Robert Stephenson during a voyage to the north of Scotland in
1857, when off Montrose, on board his yacht <i>Titania</i>; and
the reminiscence was communicated to the author by the late Mr.

prouder of this little boyish experiment than he was of many of
his subsequent achievements.&nbsp; Not having been quite
accurately stated in the first edition of this book, Mr.
Stephenson noted the correction for the second, and wrote the
author (Sept. 18th, 1857) as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In the kite
experiment, will you say, that the copper-wire was insulated by a
few feet of silk cord; without this, the experiment cannot be
made.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[70]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Zerah Colburn, in his
excellent work on &lsquo;Locomotive Engineering and the Mechanism
of Railways,&rsquo; points out that Mr. Davies Gilbert noted the
effect of the discharge of the waste steam up the chimney of
Trevithick&rsquo;s engine in increasing the draught, and wrote a
letter to &lsquo;Nicholson&rsquo;s Journal&rsquo; (Sept. 1805) on
the subject. Mr. Nicholson himself proceeded to investigate the
subject, and in 1806 he took out a patent for
&ldquo;steam-blasting apparatus,&rdquo; applicable to fixed
engines. Trevithick himself, however, could not have had much
faith in the steam-blast for locomotive purposes, or else he
would not have taken out his patent for urging the fire by means
of fanners.&nbsp; But the fact is, that while the speed of the
locomotive was only four or five miles an hour, the blast was
scarcely needed. It was only when high speeds were adopted that
artificial methods of urging the fire became necessary, and that
the full importance of the invention was recognised.&nbsp; Like
many other inventions, stimulated if not originated by necessity,
the steam-blast was certainly reinvented, if not invented, by
George Stephenson.</p>

class="footnote">[95]</a>&nbsp; The Editor of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; having (Nov. 8th, 1862)
characterized the author&rsquo;s account of this affair as
&ldquo;perfectly untrue&rdquo; and a &ldquo;fiction,&rdquo; it
becomes necessary to say a few words in explanation of it. The
Editor of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; quotes in support of
his statement a passage from Mr. Nicholas Wood, who, however does
not say that the anecdote is &ldquo;perfectly untrue,&rdquo; but
merely that &ldquo;the danger was <i>not quite so great</i> as is
represented:&rdquo; he adds that &ldquo;at most an explosion
might have burnt the hands of the operator, but would not extend
a few feet from the blower.&rdquo;&nbsp; However that may be, we
were not without good authority for making the original
statement.&nbsp; The facts were verbally communicated to the
author in the first place by Robert Stephenson, to whom the
chapter was afterwards read in MS., in the presence of Mr.
Sopwith, F.R.S. at Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s house in Gloucester
Square, and received his entire approval.&nbsp; But at the time
at which Mr. Stephenson communicated the verbal information, he
also handed a little book with his name written in it, still in
the author&rsquo;s possession, saying, &ldquo;Read that, you will
find it all there.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have again referred to the
little book which contains, among other things, a pamphlet,
entitled <i>Report on the Claims of Mr. George Stephenson
relative to the Invention of his Safety Lamp</i>.&nbsp; <i>By the
Committee appointed at a Meeting holden in Newcastle</i>, <i>on
this 1st of November</i>, <i>1817</i>.&nbsp; <i>With an Appendix
containing the Evidence</i>.&nbsp; Among the witnesses examined
were George Stephenson, Nicholas Wood, and John Moodie, and their
evidence is given in the pamphlet. We quote that of Stephenson
and Moodie, which was not contradicted, but in all material
points confirmed by Wood, and was published, we believe, with his
sanction. George Stephenson said, that he tried the first lamp
&ldquo;in a part of the mine where the air was highly explosive.
Nicholas Wood and John Moodie were his companions when the trial
was made. They became frightened when they came within hearing of
the blower, and would not go any further.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson
went alone with the lamp to the mouth of the blower,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; This evidence was confirmed by John Moodie, who said
the air of the place where the experiment was about to be tried
was such, that, if a lighted candle had been introduced, an
explosion would have taken place that would have been
&ldquo;extremely dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Told Stephenson
it was foul, and hinted at the danger; nevertheless, Stephenson
<i>would</i> try the lamp, confiding in its safety. Stephenson
took the lamp and went with it into the place in which Moodie had
been, and Moodie and Wood, apprehensive of the danger, retired to
a greater distance,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; The other details of the
statement made in the text, are fully borne out by the published
evidence, the accuracy of which, so far as the author is aware,
has never before been called in question.</p>

been <i>the first</i> to apply that principle in the construction

class="footnote">[129]</a>&nbsp; The story has been told that
George was a former suitor of Miss Hindmarsh, while occupying the
position of a humble workman at Black Callerton, but that having
been rejected by her, he made love to and married Fanny
Henderson; and that long after the death of the latter, when he
had become a comparatively thriving man, he again made up to Miss
Hindmarsh, and was on the second occasion accepted.&nbsp; This is
the popular story, and different versions of it are
current.&nbsp; Desirous of ascertaining the facts, the author
called on Thomas Hindmarsh, Mrs. Stephenson&rsquo;s brother, who
assured him that George knew nothing of his sister until he
(Hindmarsh) introduced him to her, at George&rsquo;s express
request, about the year 1818 or 1819.&nbsp; The author was
himself originally attracted by the much more romantic version of
the story, and gave publicity to it many years since; but after
Mr. Hindmarsh&rsquo;s explicit statement, he thought fit to adopt
the soberer, and perhaps, the truer view.</p>

the only instance of the extraordinary increase of population in
certain localities, occasioned by railways.&nbsp; Hartlepool, in
the same neighbourhood, has in thirty years increased from 1330
to above 15,000; and Stockton-on-Tees from 7763 to above
16,000.&nbsp; In 1831 Crewe was a little village with 295
inhabitants; it now numbers upwards of 10,000.&nbsp; Rugby and
Swindon have quadrupled their population in the same time.&nbsp;
The railway has been the making of Southampton, and added 30,000
to its formerly small number of inhabitants.&nbsp; In like manner
the railway has taken London to the sea-side, and increased the
population of Brighton from 40,000 to nearly 100,000.&nbsp; That
of Folkestone has been trebled.&nbsp; New and populous suburbs
have sprung up all round London.&nbsp; The population of
Stratford-le-Bow and West Ham was 11,580 in 1831; it is now
nearly 40,000.&nbsp; Reigate has been trebled in size, and
Redhill has been created by the railway.&nbsp; Blackheath, Forest
Hill, Sydenham, New Cross, Wimbledon, and a number of populous
places round London, may almost be said to have sprung into
existence since the extension of railways to them within the last
thirty years.</p>

of the plans and drawings, Mr. Gooch adds, &ldquo;When we
consider the extensive sets of drawings which most engineers have
since found it right to adopt in carrying out similar works, it
is not the least surprising feature in George Stephenson&rsquo;s
early professional career, that he should have been able to
confine himself to so limited a number as that which could be
supplied by the hands of one person in carrying out the
construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; and this
may still be said, after full allowance is made for the
alteration of system involved by the adoption of the large
contract system.&rdquo;</p>

Stephenson with the directors, in favour of the locomotive
engine, were afterwards collected and published in 1830 by Robert
Stephenson and Joseph Locke, as &ldquo;compiled from the Reports
of Mr. George Stephenson.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pamphlet was entitled,
&lsquo;Observations on the Comparative Merits of Locomotive and
Fixed Engines.&rsquo;&nbsp; Robert Stephenson, speaking of the
authorship many years after, said, &ldquo;I believe I furnished
the facts and the arguments, and Locke put them into shape.&nbsp;
Locke was a very flowery writer, whereas my style was rather bald
and unattractive; so he was the editor of the pamphlet, which
excited a good deal of attention amongst engineers at the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote207"></a><a href="#citation207"
class="footnote">[207]</a>&nbsp; The conditions were
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The engine must effectually consume its own
smoke.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The engine, if of six tons weight, must be able to
draw after it, day by day, twenty tons weight (including the
tender and water-tank) at <i>ten miles</i> an hour, with a
pressure of steam on the boiler not exceeding fifty pounds to the
square inch.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The boiler must have two safety-valves, neither of
which must be fastened down, and one of them be completely out of
the control of the engineman.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The engine and boiler must be supported on springs,
and rest on six wheels, the height of the whole not exceeding
fifteen feet to the top of the chimney.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The engine, with water, must not weigh more than six
tons; but an engine of less weight would be preferred on its
drawing a proportionate load behind it; if only four and a half
tons, then it might be put on only four wheels.&nbsp; The Company
to be at liberty to test the boiler, etc., by a pressure of one
hundred and fifty pounds to the square inch.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; A mercurial gauge must be affixed to the machine,
showing the steam pressure above forty-five pounds per square
inch.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The engine must be delivered, complete and ready for
trial, at the Liverpool end of the railway, not later than the
1st of October, 1829.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The price of the engine must not exceed
&pound;550.</p>
<p><a name="footnote214"></a><a href="#citation214"
class="footnote">[214]</a>&nbsp; The inventor of this engine was
a Swede, who afterwards proceeded to the United States, and there
achieved considerable distinction as an engineer.&nbsp; His
Caloric Engine has so far proved a failure, but his iron cupola
vessel, the &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; must be admitted to have been
a remarkable success in its way.</p>

<p><a name="footnote234"></a><a href="#citation234"
class="footnote">[234]</a>&nbsp; Tubbing is now adopted in many
cases as a substitute for brick-walling.&nbsp; The tubbing
consists of short portions of cast-iron cylinder fixed in
segments.&nbsp; Each weighs about 4&frac12; cwt., is about 3 or 4
feet long, and about &#8540; of an inch thick.&nbsp; These pieces
are fitted closely together, length under length, and form an
impermeable wall along the side of the pit.</p>
<p><a name="footnote263"></a><a href="#citation263"

engaged on the North Midland, extending from Derby to Leeds; the
York and North Midland, from Normanton to York; the Manchester
and Leeds; the Birmingham and Derby, and the Sheffield and
Rotherham Railways; the whole of these, of which he was principal
engineer, having been authorised in 1836.&nbsp; In that session
alone, powers were obtained for the construction of 214 miles of
new railways under his direction, at an expenditure of upwards of
five millions sterling.</p>
<p><a name="footnote288"></a><a href="#citation288"
class="footnote">[288]</a>&nbsp; The question of the specific
merits of the atmospheric as compared with the fixed engine and
locomotive systems, will be found fully discussed in Robert
Stephenson&rsquo;s able &lsquo;Report on the Atmospheric Railway
System,&rsquo; 1844, in which he gives the result of numerous
observations and experiments made by him on the Kingstown
Atmospheric Railway, with the object of ascertaining whether the
new power would be applicable for the working of the Chester and
Holyhead Railway, then under construction.&nbsp; His opinion was
decidedly against the atmospheric system.</p>
<p><a name="footnote289"></a><a href="#citation289"
class="footnote">[289]</a>&nbsp; The Marquis of Clanricarde
brought under the notice of the House of Lords, in 1845, that one
Charles Guernsey, the son of a charwoman, and a clerk in a
broker&rsquo;s office, at 12s. a week, had his name down as a
subscriber for shares in the London and York line, for
&pound;52,000.&nbsp; Doubtless he had been made useful for the
purpose by the brokers, his employers.</p>
<p><a name="footnote309"></a><a href="#citation309"
class="footnote">[309]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;When my father came about
the office,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;he sometimes did not well
know what to do with himself.&nbsp; So he used to invite Bidder
to have a wrestle with him, for old acquaintance&rsquo;
sake.&nbsp; And the two wrestled together so often, and had so
many &lsquo;falls&rsquo; (sometimes I thought they would bring
the house down between them), that they broke half the chairs in
my outer office.&nbsp; I remember once sending my father in a
joiner&rsquo;s bill of about &pound;2. 10s. for mending broken
chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote324"></a><a href="#citation324"
class="footnote">[324]</a>&nbsp; The simple fact that in a heavy
storm the force of impact of the waves is from one and a-half to
two tons per square foot, must necessarily dictate the greatest
possible caution in approaching so formidable an element.&nbsp;
Mr. R. Stevenson (Edinburgh) registered a force of three tons per
square foot at Skerryvore, during a gale in the Atlantic, when
the waves were supposed to run twenty feet high.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
